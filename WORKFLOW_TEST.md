# Workflow Migration Test - October 13, 2025

**Purpose**: Validate new direct-to-main workflow after develop branch removal.

## Test Validation

This PR tests that:

- ✅ Quick Check CI runs on feature branch PRs (2-3 min)
- ✅ No develop-related CI triggers fire
- ✅ Documentation changes trigger docs linting workflow

## Expected Results

When this PR is opened:
1. Quick Check workflow should execute
2. Documentation linting should execute  
3. Full test suite should NOT execute (reserved for main branch)
