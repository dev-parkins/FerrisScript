## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [FerrisScript Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### About FerrisScript

FerrisScript is a Rust-inspired scripting language designed specifically for the Godot game engine. It brings Rust's powerful type system and ownership concepts to game scripting while maintaining ease of use. The project consists of:

- **Compiler** (`crates/compiler/`): Lexer, parser, AST, and type checker
- **Runtime** (`crates/runtime/`): Execution environment for FerrisScript code
- **Godot Binding** (`crates/godot_bind/`): Integration layer with Godot 4.x

### Version Status

- **v0.0.1**: Released October 2, 2025 - Initial compiler and runtime implementation
- **v0.0.2**: In progress - Documentation improvements and community standards

### File Extensions

FerrisScript uses the `.ferris` file extension for all script files (not `.rscr`).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Understanding Issue Labels

FerrisScript uses a comprehensive label system to organize issues and pull requests. Understanding these labels helps you find tasks that match your interests and skill level.

#### Label Categories

**Priority Labels** (urgency):

- `P0-Critical` üî¥ - Critical bugs or blockers requiring immediate attention
- `P1-High` üü† - High priority tasks that should be addressed soon  
- `P2-Medium` üü° - Medium priority tasks for regular workflow
- `P3-Low` üü¢ - Low priority tasks or nice-to-have improvements

**Type Labels** (nature of work):

- `bug` üêõ - Something isn't working correctly
- `feature` ‚ú® - New feature or functionality request
- `documentation` üìñ - Documentation improvements or additions
- `enhancement` ‚ö° - Improvement to existing functionality
- `question` ‚ùì - Questions or clarifications needed
- `discussion` üí¨ - General discussion topics

**Status Labels** (current state):

- `needs-triage` üè∑Ô∏è - New issue awaiting initial review
- `in-progress` üöß - Work is actively being done
- `blocked` üö´ - Blocked by external dependencies
- `wontfix` ‚õî - Issue will not be addressed (with explanation)

**Difficulty Labels** (skill level):

- `good-first-issue` üå± - Good for newcomers to the project

- `ci` - Related to CI/CD, GitHub Actions, workflows

#### How to Use Labels

**Finding Issues to Work On:**

```
# Good for beginners
https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/issues?q=is:open+label:good-first-issue

# Documentation improvements
https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/issues?q=is:open+label:documentation

# High priority bugs
https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/issues?q=is:open+label:P1-High+label:bug

# Compiler-related work
https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/issues?q=is:open+label:compiler
```

**When Creating Issues:**

- Maintainers will add appropriate labels during triage
- You can suggest labels in your issue description
- Labels help us prioritize and organize work

**When Working on Issues:**

- Check labels to understand priority and scope
- Look for `good-first-issue` if you're new
- Issues with `needs-triage` may need more discussion

For complete label documentation, see [`docs/GITHUB_LABELS.md`](docs/GITHUB_LABELS.md).

### Contributing Documentation

Documentation improvements are always appreciated! This includes:

- Fixing typos or unclear explanations
- Adding examples to existing documentation
- Writing tutorials or guides
- Improving code comments
- Translating documentation (future)

**Important**: Before contributing documentation:

1. Review the [Anti-Duplication Matrix](docs/SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md) to ensure you're editing the primary location for content
2. Link to existing documentation rather than duplicating it
3. Check [DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION.md) for where new docs should live
4. **Run documentation linting locally** before pushing (see [Documentation Quality Checks](#documentation-quality-checks) below)

Use the [documentation template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.md) when creating documentation-related issues.

#### Documentation Quality Checks

**IMPORTANT**: Always run documentation linting locally before pushing to catch issues early!

We use automated tools to ensure documentation quality:

- **markdownlint**: Checks markdown formatting consistency
- **markdown-link-check**: Verifies all links work (internal and external)

**Quick Setup** (first time only):

```bash
npm install
```

**Before Every Documentation Commit**:

```bash
# Check markdown formatting (style/syntax)
npm run docs:lint

# Auto-fix formatting issues
npm run docs:fix

# Check for broken links (optional, but recommended)
npx markdown-link-check your-file.md
```

**What `npm run docs:lint` Checks**:

- ‚úÖ Heading hierarchy and style
- ‚úÖ List formatting consistency
- ‚úÖ Code block formatting
- ‚úÖ Line length (soft limit: 120 chars)
- ‚úÖ Trailing whitespace

**Note:** Link checking is done automatically in CI, but you can check individual files locally with `markdown-link-check` if needed.

- ‚úÖ External links (with retries)

**CI Integration**: These same checks run automatically on pull requests. Catching issues locally saves review time!

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for detailed documentation linting guide.

### Contributing Code

Code contributions are welcome for:

- Bug fixes
- New features (after discussion in an issue)
- Performance improvements
- Test coverage improvements
- Refactoring for better maintainability

**Before starting work on code**, please:

1. **Open an issue** (or comment on an existing one) to discuss your approach
2. **Wait for feedback** from maintainers to ensure alignment
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main` for your work

#### Maintaining Syntax Highlighting

When adding new language features (keywords, operators, types, syntax constructs), you must update the VS Code syntax highlighting:

1. Edit `extensions/vscode/syntaxes/ferrisscript.tmLanguage.json` to add the new patterns
2. Test the highlighting on `.ferris` example files
3. Update `extensions/vscode/CHANGELOG.md` to document the changes
4. Consider adding relevant code snippets to `extensions/vscode/snippets/ferrisscript.json`

See [SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING_MAINTENANCE.md](docs/SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING_MAINTENANCE.md) for detailed instructions, examples, and a quarterly audit checklist.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Rust 1.70+** (we use 1.90.0 in development)
- **Git** for version control
- **A text editor or IDE** (VS Code with rust-analyzer recommended)

For detailed installation instructions, see the [README.md Installation section](README.md#installation).

**Do not duplicate installation instructions here** - always link to the README.md as the single source of truth.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   # Fork via GitHub UI, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FerrisScript.git
   cd FerrisScript
   ```

2. **Add the upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript.git
   ```

3. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Run the tests** to verify your setup:

   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

All 96 tests should pass. If they don't, please open an issue.

### Running Examples

To verify your environment setup, try running an example:

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run an example
cargo run --bin rustyscript_runtime examples/hello.ferris
```

You should see "Hello from FerrisScript!" printed to the console.

## Development Workflow

**Starting with v0.0.3**, FerrisScript uses a **staged development workflow** with three branch types:

### Branch Structure

- **`main`**: Production-ready code, protected
  - Only receives PRs from `develop`
  - Requires code review and passing CI
  - Triggers release workflows

- **`develop`**: Integration/staging branch
  - Accepts PRs from `feature/*` branches
  - Full CI suite runs on every push
  - Tests multiple features together before release

- **`feature/*`**: Individual feature branches
  - Created from `develop` (not `main`)
  - Quick CI checks only (2-3 min feedback)
  - One feature per branch

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Work on your changes
# ... make changes ...

# Test locally (same checks as CI)
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Push and create PR to develop
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
gh pr create --base develop --title "feat: Your feature description"
```

### CI Behavior by Branch

**Feature Branches** (`feature/*`):

- ‚ö° **Quick Check** (2-3 minutes):
  - Code formatting (`cargo fmt`)
  - Linting (`cargo clippy`)
  - Unit tests only (Ubuntu)
- üéØ **Goal**: Fast feedback during development
- üí∞ **Savings**: ~60-70% CI time vs full suite

**Develop Branch**:

- üîÑ **Full Test Suite** (~10-15 minutes):
  - Cross-platform tests (Linux, Windows, macOS)
  - All tests (unit + integration)
  - Code coverage reporting
  - Release builds
- üéØ **Goal**: Integration testing before release

**Main Branch**:

- ‚úÖ **Full Test Suite + Release**:
  - Everything from develop
  - Creates GitHub release on tags
- üéØ **Goal**: Production validation

### Path Filters (Docs-Only Changes)

If you only change documentation files, CI will be skipped entirely on feature branches:

**Skipped paths**:

- `docs/**`
- `*.md` files
- `LICENSE`
- `.gitignore`

This saves ~95% CI time for documentation PRs!

### Release Flow

```bash
# Feature development
feature/my-feature ‚Üí develop (via PR)
feature/another-feature ‚Üí develop (via PR)

# After multiple features tested on develop
develop ‚Üí main (via PR)

# Creates release
main ‚Üí tagged release (v0.0.3)
```

## Pull Request Process

We use a **feature branch workflow** with **squash and merge** strategy.

### Branch Naming Convention

We use **branch name prefixes** to automatically apply the appropriate PR template:

| Prefix | Use For | PR Template Applied |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| `bugfix/` or `fix/` | Bug fixes | üêõ Bug Fix Template |
| `feature/` or `feat/` | New features | ‚ú® Feature Template |
| `docs/` or `doc/` | Documentation | üìù Documentation Template |

**Examples:**

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/parser-null-pointer
git checkout -b feature/async-script-loading
git checkout -b docs/add-api-examples
```

üí° **Tip:** When you create a PR, our automation will detect your branch name and automatically apply the appropriate template!

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop` with the appropriate prefix:

   ```bash
   # Start from develop
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   
   # For bug fixes
   git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-description
   
   # For new features
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   
   # For documentation
   git checkout -b docs/your-doc-update
   ```

2. **Make your changes** in small, logical commits:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with parser"
   ```

3. **Keep your branch up to date** with `develop`:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/develop
   ```

4. **Push your branch**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request** to `develop` (not `main`) via GitHub:
   - **Base branch**: `develop` (important!)
   - Use a clear, descriptive title following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   - The appropriate PR template will be **automatically applied** based on your branch name
   - Fill out all sections marked with `<!-- ... -->` comments
   - Reference related issues (e.g., "Closes #42", "Fixes #123")
   - Describe what changed and why

### PR Templates

We have specialized templates for different PR types:

- **üêõ Bug Fix** ([bug_fix.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/bug_fix.md))
  - Focus: Root cause, regression testing, before/after comparison
  - Auto-applied for: `bugfix/*` or `fix/*` branches

- **‚ú® Feature** ([feature.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/feature.md))
  - Focus: Motivation, usage examples, breaking changes, performance
  - Auto-applied for: `feature/*` or `feat/*` branches

- **üìù Documentation** ([docs.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/docs.md))
  - Focus: Markdown linting, link checking, code example testing
  - Auto-applied for: `docs/*` or `doc/*` branches

**Manual Selection:** You can also manually choose a template when creating a PR via the GitHub dropdown menu.

### PR Requirements

Before your PR can be merged:

- ‚úÖ All tests must pass (`cargo test`)
- ‚úÖ Code must be formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- ‚úÖ Code must pass linting (`cargo clippy`)
- ‚úÖ Documentation must be updated (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md must be updated (see below)
- ‚úÖ At least one maintainer approval

### Merge Strategy

- **Feature branches**: We use **squash and merge** to keep main branch history clean
- **Hotfix branches**: We use **merge commit** to preserve context
- **Branch deletion**: Branches are automatically deleted after merge (enable in your fork's settings)

### Draft Pull Requests

You can open a PR early as a **draft** to get feedback:

- Mark as draft in the PR creation UI
- Or add `[WIP]` to the title
- Add a "Notes to Reviewers" section explaining current status

### Updating CHANGELOG.md

For significant changes, update the `[Unreleased]` section in CHANGELOG.md:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Your new feature description

### Fixed
- Your bug fix description

### Changed
- Your modification description
```

Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Rust Style

We follow standard Rust conventions:

- **Formatting**: Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- **Linting**: Fix all `cargo clippy` warnings
- **Naming**:
  - `snake_case` for functions, variables, modules
  - `PascalCase` for types, traits, enums
  - `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- **Comments**:
  - Use `///` for public API documentation
  - Use `//` for inline comments
  - Explain "why", not "what"

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused (one responsibility)
- Group related functionality into modules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer explicit over implicit

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:

```
feat(parser): add support for match expressions
fix(lexer): handle escaped quotes in strings
docs: update installation instructions for Windows
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Every new feature should include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Place tests in the same file using `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- Use descriptive test names: `test_parser_handles_nested_functions`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p rustyscript_compiler

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_lexer_tokenizes_keywords

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage, especially for:

- Parser and lexer (edge cases, error handling)
- Type checker (all type rules, error messages)
- Runtime (execution correctness, error recovery)

#### Running Code Coverage

FerrisScript uses two code coverage tools for different environments:

- **cargo-llvm-cov** - Preferred for local development (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **cargo-tarpaulin** - Used in CI (Linux only, due to Windows file locking issues)

**Quick Start - Running Coverage Locally**:

```bash
# PowerShell (Windows)
.\scripts\coverage.ps1

# Bash (Linux/macOS)
./scripts/coverage.sh
```

The scripts will:

1. Automatically install `cargo-llvm-cov` if not present
2. Run coverage analysis across all workspace crates
3. Generate both HTML and LCOV reports in `target/coverage/`

**Viewing Coverage Reports**:

```powershell
# Windows - Open HTML report
Invoke-Item target/coverage/html/index.html

# Linux
xdg-open target/coverage/html/index.html

# macOS
open target/coverage/html/index.html
```

**Manual Coverage Commands**:

```bash
# Install prerequisites (first time only)
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov

# Run coverage with HTML output
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --html --output-dir target/coverage

# Run coverage with LCOV output (for external tools)
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov --output-path target/coverage/lcov.info

# Run coverage for specific crate
cargo llvm-cov -p ferrisscript_compiler --html
```

**Understanding Coverage Results**:

- **Green lines**: Covered by tests
- **Red lines**: Not covered by tests
- **Yellow lines**: Partially covered (branches)
- **Coverage percentage**: Shown per file and overall

**Coverage Goals**:

- **Current baseline**: Established in test coverage analysis
- **Target for new code**: 80%+ line coverage
- **Critical paths**: Parser, type checker, runtime should have high coverage

**Why Two Tools?**

- **cargo-llvm-cov**: Cross-platform, native Rust tooling, no file locking issues on Windows
- **cargo-tarpaulin**: More mature in CI environments, used in GitHub Actions (Linux runners)

See [docs/COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md](docs/COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md) for technical details on the Windows file locking issue that led to this dual-tool approach.

**Before Submitting a PR**:

For significant code changes:

1. Run coverage locally: `.\scripts\coverage.ps1` or `./scripts/coverage.sh`
2. Check that your new code is covered by tests
3. Aim for 80%+ coverage on modified files
4. CI will also run coverage checks using tarpaulin

**Troubleshooting Coverage Issues**:

- **"cargo-llvm-cov not found"**: The script will auto-install it, or run `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov` manually
- **Windows file locking errors**: Close VS Code and rust-analyzer, or use the provided scripts which avoid these issues
- **Coverage seems low**: Ensure tests are actually executing your code paths; add `#[cfg(test)]` module tests
- **CI coverage differs from local**: CI uses tarpaulin (Linux), local uses llvm-cov; minor differences are normal

### Testing with Godot (Deferred)

Currently, Godot integration testing is deferred as it requires manual setup. See [FUTURE_AUTOMATION.md](docs/FUTURE_AUTOMATION.md) for plans to automate this in v0.0.3+.
