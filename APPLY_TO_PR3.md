## What Still Needs User Attention

See `DOCS_LINT_FIXES.md` for detailed information about:

1. **MD029** - Ordered list prefix style (7 instances in CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. **MD036** - Emphasis used as heading (37 instances, mostly "Made with ü¶Ä" footers)
3. **MD056** - Malformed tables (3 instances in VERSION_PLANNING.md)
4. **Link Check Failures** - Broken links to missing files and private URLs

These require user decisions and cannot be auto-fixed.
