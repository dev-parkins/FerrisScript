# Workstream Execution - Quick Reference

**TL;DR**: Invoke `/prompt #file:workstream-execution.prompt.md` + context ‚Üí Copilot asks questions ‚Üí Creates execution plan ‚Üí Works systematically

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

```
/prompt #file:workstream-execution.prompt.md

Context:
- #file:[checklist or requirements file]
- Highlighted: [paste relevant text]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
```

---

## üìã What Happens Next

### 1. Context Gathering (5-10 min)

- Copilot reads your context
- Asks 5-15 clarifying questions
- You answer the questions
- Copilot confirms understanding

### 2. Execution Planning (10-15 min)

- Creates execution plan document
- Defines acceptance criteria  
- Breaks work into phases
- Creates TODO list
- Gets your approval

### 3. Implementation (varies)

- Works through phases one at a time
- Updates TODO list for visibility
- Runs quality checks after each phase
- Documents decisions as they're made

### 4. Validation & Documentation (30-60 min)

- Runs full test suite
- Runs all linting
- Verifies all acceptance criteria met
- Updates related documentation
- Creates summary with learnings

5. What NOT to change?

### About Constraints (5 questions)

1. What changes are allowed?
2. What changes NOT allowed?
3. Performance requirements?

2. What linting must pass?
3. Test coverage target?
4. Documentation requirements?
5. Code review process?

### About Workflow (5 questions)

1. Branch naming?
2. Commit message format?
3. Where do files go?
4. What docs need updating?
5. How to track progress?

**Note**: Copilot won't ask ALL questions - only what's unclear from context.

## ‚úÖ What You Get

### Execution Plan Document

```markdown
# [Workstream] Execution Plan

## Q&A: Context Gathering
[All questions and your answers recorded]

## Decisions Made
[Design decisions and trade-offs]

## Acceptance Criteria
[Specific, testable requirements]

## Execution Phases
[Phases with tasks and status]

## Deliverables
[Files to create/modify]

## Learnings & Discoveries
[What we learned]
```

### Quality Validation

- All tests pass
- All linting passes
- All acceptance criteria met
- Documentation updated
- Summary document created

---

## üìä Progress Visibility

### TODO List Format

```markdown
- [x] Phase 0: Planning ‚úÖ
  - Created execution plan with Q&A
- [-] Phase 1: Implementation üîÑ  
  - Working on task 2 of 5...
- [ ] Phase 2: Validation ‚è∏Ô∏è
- [ ] Phase 3: Documentation ‚è∏Ô∏è
```

**Legend**:

- `[x]` = Complete
- `[-]` = In Progress (current phase)
- `[ ]` = Not Started
- `[!]` = Blocked

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria Examples

### Good (Specific, Measurable)

‚úÖ "All errors must include line number, column, and ¬±2 lines of context"  
‚úÖ "Empty file tests must pass without panicking (3 tests)"  
‚úÖ "Test coverage increases by 5-10% (measured with cargo tarpaulin)"  
‚úÖ "All edge case tests complete in < 100ms each"

### Bad (Vague, Unmeasurable)

‚ùå "Improve error messages" (how? by how much?)  
‚ùå "Add some tests" (which ones? how many?)  
‚ùå "Better documentation" (what makes it better?)  
‚ùå "Fix performance" (what's the target?)

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Copilot Doesn't Ask Enough Questions

**Solution**: Provide less context upfront, or say "Please ask clarifying questions about [specific area]"

### Issue: Copilot Asks Too Many Questions

**Solution**: Provide more context upfront (attach more files, be more specific)

### Issue: Work Doesn't Fit Template

**Solution**: The prompt is generic! Just provide your specific context - Copilot adapts

### Issue: Unclear Acceptance Criteria

**Solution**: In Q&A phase, explicitly ask "What makes this complete?" and be specific

### Issue: Copilot Skips Quality Checks

**Solution**: Remind it to run the quality checklist before marking phases complete

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Attach Context Files

```
/prompt #file:workstream-execution.prompt.md

Context:
- #file:docs/v0.0.2/v0.0.2-CHECKLIST.md
- #file:docs/v0.0.2/LEARNINGS.md (see "Edge Case Tests" section)
- #file:docs/v0.0.2/TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md (see gaps)
```

More context = fewer questions needed.

### Tip 2: Highlight Specific Text

Copy relevant checklist items or requirements and paste them:

```
Highlighted from checklist:
"- [ ] Test edge cases: empty files, comments-only, long variable names
 - [ ] Better error messages with line numbers and context
 - [ ] Colorized error output for Godot console"
```

### Tip 3: Specify Priority

Help Copilot prioritize:

```
Priority: High (blocking v0.0.2 release)
Timeline: Complete by end of week
```

### Tip 4: Reference Prior Work

```
Related work:
- PR #42 added 20 edge case tests (different ones)
- See docs/v0.0.2/LEARNINGS.md for what's already done
```

### Tip 5: Stay Engaged

- Answer questions promptly
- Review execution plan before implementation
- Check TODO updates periodically
- Provide feedback on approach
