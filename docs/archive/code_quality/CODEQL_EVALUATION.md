## 🔍 What is CodeQL?

**CodeQL** is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that treats code as data, enabling queries to find security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Security Vulnerability Detection**:
   - SQL injection, XSS, CSRF (for web languages)
   - Buffer overflows, memory safety issues (for C/C++)
   - Command injection, path traversal
   - Cryptographic weaknesses

2. **Code Quality Analysis**:
   - Dead code detection
   - Unused variables
   - Complex control flow
   - Potential null dereferences

3. **Custom Query Language**:
   - Write custom queries for project-specific patterns
   - Share queries across teams
   - Community query packs

### Rust Support

CodeQL has **improved Rust support** (as of October 2025):

- Query support for Rust is now in beta, with coverage expanding beyond basic queries
- Still limited compared to mature languages (C++, Java, JavaScript), but significant progress since 2024
- GitHub continues to invest in Rust tooling, with regular updates
- Community queries are maturing, though not yet as extensive as for other languages
- Improving rapidly (GitHub investing in Rust tooling)
- Community queries less mature than other languages

## 🔧 Current CI/CD Landscape

### Existing Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Strengths | Rust Support |
|------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **cargo clippy** | Linting & best practices | Rust-native, comprehensive rules, fast | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Native |
| **SonarQube** | Code quality & security | Multi-language, technical debt tracking | ⭐⭐ Generic analysis |
| **cargo test** | Functional correctness | Compile-time safety, runtime validation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Native |
| **cargo-tarpaulin** | Code coverage | Coverage metrics, trend tracking | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Native |

### Coverage Areas

#### Existing Coverage ✅

- **Memory Safety**: Rust compiler (borrow checker, ownership)
- **Type Safety**: Rust compiler (strong static typing)
- **Best Practices**: cargo clippy (480+ lints)
- **Code Smells**: SonarQube (duplication, complexity)
- **Security Basics**: clippy (e.g., `clippy::suspicious`, `clippy::correctness`)
- **Panics**: clippy (`clippy::panic`, `clippy::unwrap_used`)

#### Potential Gaps (Where CodeQL Could Add Value)

- **Cross-function taint analysis**: Tracking user input through multiple functions
- **Advanced control flow analysis**: Complex state machines, race conditions
- **Cryptographic misuse**: Weak algorithms, improper key handling
- **Custom security patterns**: Project-specific vulnerability patterns
- **Dependency vulnerability patterns**: Unsafe usage of external crates

#### Setup Time: **1-2 hours**

1. Create `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (30 min)
   - Copy GitHub's Rust template
   - Configure triggers (PR, push to main/develop)
   - Set up caching

2. Configure `codeql-config.yml` (30 min)
   - Select query suites (security-extended recommended)
   - Configure paths to analyze
   - Set up custom queries (if needed)

3. Test and iterate (30-60 min)
   - Run workflow on test branch
   - Review findings
   - Tune false positives

#### Ongoing Maintenance: **1-2 hours/month**

- Review CodeQL findings (30 min/week)
- Tune queries to reduce false positives (15 min/week)
- Update query packs (quarterly, 30 min)
- CI time budget management (monitor runtime)

### CI Impact

**Additional Runtime**: +5-10 minutes per workflow run

- Initial analysis: ~8-10 minutes (first run)
- Incremental analysis: ~5-7 minutes (cached)
- Parallel execution: Runs alongside other jobs (no blocking)

**Cost**: Minimal (CodeQL free for public repos)

## 💰 Value Proposition

### High-Value Scenarios

**CodeQL is valuable if**:

- ✅ Project handles untrusted user input (web servers, parsers)
- ✅ Project has complex data flow (compilers, interpreters)
- ✅ Project uses cryptography or security-sensitive APIs
- ✅ Team wants to write custom security queries
- ✅ Project has 10+ external dependencies with security concerns

**CodeQL is less valuable if**:

- ❌ Project is simple library with no user input
- ❌ CI runtime is a critical constraint (need fast pipelines)
- ❌ Team has limited time to review findings
- ❌ Rust compiler + clippy already catch 95% of issues

### FerrisScript-Specific Assessment

**Current State (v0.0.3)**:

- Scripting language compiler (moderate complexity)
- Parses user input (`.ferris` scripts)
- No web exposure, no network I/O
- Limited external dependencies (10-15 crates)
- Strong Rust type safety already in place

**Value Rating**: **Medium (3/5)**

- **Pros**: Could catch complex parser edge cases, taint analysis for script input
- **Cons**: Rust compiler + clippy already robust, CI time budget is tight
- **Verdict**: Useful but not critical at this stage

## 📋 Implementation Approach (If Proceeding)

### Phase 1: Pilot (1 sprint)

1. Add CodeQL workflow with basic configuration
2. Run on `develop` branch only (not blocking PRs)
3. Review findings weekly
4. Document false positives and true positives

### Phase 2: Evaluation (1 sprint)

1. Measure CI impact (runtime, cost)
2. Assess finding quality (true positive rate)
3. Compare value vs. effort
4. Decide: Keep, tune, or remove

### Phase 3: Production (If valuable)

1. Enable for PRs (non-blocking)
2. Integrate with PR review process
3. Write custom queries for FerrisScript patterns
4. Enable security alerts

### Sample Workflow Configuration

```yaml
name: CodeQL Analysis
on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]  # Start with develop only
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * 1'  # Weekly scan

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze Rust Code
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      actions: read
      contents: read

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Initialize CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
        with:
          languages: rust
          queries: security-extended  # Recommended query suite

      - name: Build project
        run: cargo build --workspace --all-features

      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
        with:
          category: "rust-analysis"
```

**Runtime**: ~8 minutes first run, ~5 minutes cached

## ✅ Recommendation

### Short-Term (v0.0.3 - v0.0.4)

**❌ Do NOT implement CodeQL yet**

**Reasoning**:

1. **Current tools sufficient**: clippy + SonarQube + Rust compiler cover 95% of issues
2. **CI time budget**: Already running 4 workflows (ci.yml, code-scanning.yml, docs-lint.yml, benchmarks.yml)
3. **Experimental Rust support**: CodeQL Rust support is improving but not mature
4. **Focus on features**: v0.0.3-0.0.4 focused on language features, not infrastructure
5. **ROI unclear**: No evidence of gaps in current security/quality coverage

### Mid-Term (v0.1.0+)

**✅ Re-evaluate CodeQL after v0.1.0**

**Trigger Conditions**:

1. Project handles network I/O or web APIs (higher security surface)
2. External dependency count >20 (supply chain risk increases)
3. Community contributions increase (need automated security review)
4. CodeQL Rust support matures (check GitHub roadmap)
5. CI time budget allows (+10 min per run acceptable)

### Long-Term (v0.2.0+)

**✅ Consider custom CodeQL queries for FerrisScript**

**Use Cases**:

- Detect unsafe script patterns (e.g., infinite loops in user scripts)
- Analyze Godot API usage patterns
- Track taint flow from script input to Godot engine calls
- Enforce security policies (e.g., no file system access from scripts)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics (If Implemented)

### Quantitative

- **True Positive Rate**: >60% of findings actionable
- **False Positive Rate**: <30% of findings false alarms
- **CI Impact**: <10 minutes additional runtime
- **Coverage Increase**: +5% security vulnerability detection vs. current tools

### Qualitative

- Findings provide insights not available from clippy/SonarQube
- Custom queries successfully catch FerrisScript-specific issues
- Team finds value in reviewing CodeQL reports
- GitHub security alerts reduce dependency vulnerabilities
