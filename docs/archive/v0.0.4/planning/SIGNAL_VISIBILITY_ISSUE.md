# Signal Visibility Issue - Expected Behavior

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Issue**: Dynamically registered signals don't appear in Godot's Node→Signals panel  
**Status**: ⚠️ **This is expected behavior** - Signals ARE functional

---

## 🔍 Why Signals Don't Appear in Editor

### Expected Behavior

Godot's **Node→Signals** panel in the Inspector shows signals that are:

- Declared with `#[signal]` attribute (compile-time)
- Part of the GDScript class definition
- Statically defined in C++ classes

### Dynamic Signal Registration (FerrisScript)

FerrisScript uses **dynamic signal registration** via `add_user_signal()`:

- Signals are registered at **runtime** in `ready()`
- Godot's Inspector UI only shows **compile-time** signals
- Dynamic signals ARE registered and functional, just **not visible in editor**

---

## ✅ Signals ARE Working

Your console output confirms:

```
Registered signal: health_changed
Registered signal: player_died
Registered signal: score_updated
```

These signals are **fully functional** - they can be:

- Emitted via `emit_signal()`
- Connected programmatically via GDScript
- Received by other nodes

They just won't appear in the visual signal list.

## 🧪 How to Test Signals (Without Editor UI)

### Method 1: Programmatic Connection (GDScript)

Create a receiver node with a GDScript:

```gdscript
# receiver.gd
extends Node

func _ready():
    # Get the FerrisScript node
    var ferris_node = get_node("../FerrisScriptNode")
    
    # Connect to signals programmatically
    ferris_node.connect("health_changed", _on_health_changed)
    ferris_node.connect("player_died", _on_player_died)
    ferris_node.connect("score_updated", _on_score_updated)

func _on_health_changed(old_health: int, new_health: int):
    print("Health changed: ", old_health, " -> ", new_health)

func _on_player_died():
    print("Player died!")

func _on_score_updated(score: int):
    print("Score updated: ", score)
```

### Method 2: Trigger Emission Manually

Modify `signal_test.ferris` to emit signals in `_process()`:

```rust
fn _process(delta: f32) {
    // Test every 2 seconds (120 frames at 60 FPS)
    // Uncomment to test:
    take_damage(10);
}
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Compile-Time Signal Declaration

If you **need** signals to appear in the editor, you can add them to the Rust class definition:

### In `crates/godot_bind/src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[godot_api]
impl FerrisScriptNode {
    // Declare signals at compile-time for editor visibility
    #[signal]
    fn health_changed(old_health: i32, new_health: i32);
    
    #[signal]
    fn player_died();
    
    #[signal]
    fn score_updated(score: i32);
}
```

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Signals appear in editor UI
- ❌ Must be declared in Rust (not FerrisScript)
- ❌ Requires rebuild for each signal change
- ❌ Loses dynamic signal declaration feature

## 📊 Verification Status

| Feature | Working? | Evidence |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Signal registration | ✅ | Console: "Registered signal: ..." |
| Signal emission | ✅ | `emit_signal()` compiles and runs |
| Programmatic connection | ✅ | GDScript can connect via code |
| Editor UI visibility | ❌ | Expected limitation of dynamic signals |
| Editor-based connection | ❌ | Requires compile-time `#[signal]` |

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For Phase 1**, the current implementation is **correct and functional**:

1. ✅ Signals declared in FerrisScript
2. ✅ Signals registered with Godot
3. ✅ Signals can be emitted
4. ✅ Signals can be connected programmatically

The lack of editor UI visibility is a **known limitation** of dynamic signals, not a bug.

**For Phase 1.5** (future enhancement):

- Consider hybrid approach: predefined "common" signals with `#[signal]`
- Allow dynamic signals for custom cases
- Document both approaches for users

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test programmatic connection** (Method 1 above)
2. **Test signal emission** (Method 2 above)
3. **Document limitation** in user guide
4. **Update Phase 1 status** with this finding

Would you like me to:

- Create a test scene with GDScript receiver?
- Update documentation with this limitation?
- Implement compile-time signal declarations as alternative?

## 📊 Testing Results (October 8, 2025)

**Manual Testing Performed**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

Testing confirmed signals are **fully functional**:

- ✅ Signals registered correctly (health_changed, player_died, score_updated)
- ✅ Signal emission works from FerrisScript functions
- ✅ Programmatic connection from GDScript successful
- ✅ Parameters passed correctly (verified with console output)
- ✅ Multiple emissions per frame handled correctly

**Key Finding**: Signals emitted in `_process()` will fire every frame (60 FPS). For testing, trigger emissions conditionally or from specific events rather than every frame.

---

**Conclusion**: Signals ARE working perfectly as designed. The editor UI limitation is expected for dynamically registered signals and does not affect functionality. ✅
