   - **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing guide for v0.0.2
   - **Sections**:
     - Overview (testing goals, current coverage 70-75%, 116 tests)
     - Quick Start (running tests, coverage generation)
     - Writing Tests (naming conventions, templates, best practices)
     - Test Coverage (current status, goals by module, generation methods)

### Files Modified (5)

1. **package.json**
   - **Changes**: Removed duplicate `docs:check` script (was just aliasing `docs:lint`)
   - **Impact**: Simplified documentation workflow, clearer script intent
   - **Before**: Had `docs:lint`, `docs:fix`, `docs:check` (redundant)
   - **After**: Only `docs:lint` and `docs:fix`

2. **godot_test/README.md**
   - **Changes**: Enhanced with "Adding New Test Scripts" section
   - **Content Added**:
     - Step-by-step test script creation guide (4 steps with code examples)
     - Reusable test script template
     - Testing best practices (5 key principles)
     - Common test patterns (position, state, conditionals with code)
   - **Updates**: Version info to v0.0.2 (October 5, 2025)
   - **Links**: Added reference to docs/v0.0.2/TESTING.md

3. **docs/v0.0.2/v0.0.2-CHECKLIST.md**
   - **Changes**: Marked README, TESTING.md, godot_test/README, and cleanup sections complete
   - **Details**: Added Phase 5C completion notes with deliverables and outcomes
   - **Findings**: Documented checklist drift (README items already present)

4. **docs/planning/v0.0.2-roadmap.md**
   - **Changes**: Updated sections 7-10 (README, TESTING.md, cleanup, godot_test) to complete
   - **Progress**: Updated overall progress from ~85% to ~90% complete
   - **Timeline**: Updated remaining work from 15-20 hours to 6-10 hours
   - **Summary**: Added Phase 5C to completed work section

5. **docs/v0.0.2/TESTING.md** (link fix)
   - **Changes**: Fixed broken link to COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md
   - **Before**: `[COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md](COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md)` (broken)
   - **After**: `[COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md](../COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md)` (working)

### Files Analyzed (1)

1. **README.md**
   - **Purpose**: Verify completeness per roadmap requirements
   - **Findings**: All required sections already present
     - ‚úÖ "Why FerrisScript?" section (with emoji header)
     - ‚úÖ GDScript comparison table (detailed feature comparison)
     - ‚úÖ Performance notes (in comparison table, ~1 Œºs/function call)
     - ‚úÖ Troubleshooting quick links (in header: FAQ, Troubleshooting)
     - ‚ùå Test coverage badge missing (but no CI integration to support it)
   - **Conclusion**: Confirms checklist drift from earlier work
   - **Action**: No changes needed, verified as complete

---

## üîç Key Findings

### Checklist Drift Confirmed

**Issue**: Roadmap listed 5 items to add to README.md, but all were already present.

**Root Cause**: Earlier phases completed these items without updating the roadmap/checklist.

**Items Present**:
1. "Why FerrisScript?" section - Already added in earlier work
2. GDScript comparison table - Already comprehensive
3. Performance notes - Already included in comparison
4. Troubleshooting quick links - Already in header
5. Test coverage badge - Not added (requires CI integration)

**Impact**: No wasted effort, but highlights need for real-time tracking updates.

**Lesson**: Always update tracking documents immediately when completing work.

### No Documentation Duplicates

**Expectation**: Roadmap mentioned "Remove duplicate DEVELOPMENT.md from docs/"

**Reality**: Only one DEVELOPMENT.md exists (in `docs/` directory)

**Conclusion**: Either already cleaned up earlier, or checklist item was speculative

**Outcome**: No cleanup needed, verification only

### Package.json Script Redundancy

**Discovery**: `docs:check` script was identical to `docs:lint` (just aliased it)

**Action**: Removed `docs:check` script to simplify workflow

**Benefit**: Clearer intent, less confusion for contributors

## üéì Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **Version-Specific Documentation Strategy**
   - Decision: Keep TESTING.md in `docs/v0.0.2/` until version finalized
   - Rationale: Easier to track version-specific testing requirements
   - Future: Move to `docs/` after v0.0.2 release

2. **Link Path Conventions**
   - Issue: Relative links from `docs/v0.0.2/` to `docs/` require `../` prefix
   - Solution: Use `../COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md` instead of `COVERAGE_SETUP_NOTES.md`
   - Lesson: Always test links with markdown-link-check before committing

3. **Comprehensive Testing Documentation Value**
   - Impact: 500+ line TESTING.md covers all aspects (quick start ‚Üí future plans)
   - Benefit: Single source of truth for all testing knowledge
   - Future: Reference guide for contributors, reduces onboarding time

### Process Improvements

1. **Real-Time Tracking Updates**
   - Issue: Checklist drift occurred because tracking docs not updated immediately
   - Solution: Update tracking docs as soon as work completes (not batch at end)
   - Benefit: Prevents duplicate work, clearer progress visibility

2. **Emphasis vs. Headers Preference**
   - User Guidance: Prefer `### Header` over `**Bold Text**` for semantic meaning
   - Tool Limitation: markdownlint doesn't auto-fix this (manual review needed)
   - Implementation: Noted for future manual reviews

3. **Link Validation Early and Often**
   - Strategy: Run markdown-link-check on each file after creation
   - Benefit: Catch broken links immediately, easier to fix in context
   - Tool: `npx markdown-link-check <file>` (no installation needed)

### Workflow Optimizations

1. **Content Creation First, Validation Second**
   - Pattern: Complete all content tasks (1-6) before validation tasks (7-9)
   - Rationale: Minimize context switching, batch similar work
   - Result: More efficient, clearer progress milestones

2. **Comprehensive Guides Over Scattered Info**
   - Decision: Create single comprehensive TESTING.md vs. multiple small docs
   - Benefit: Easier to maintain, better user experience (one place to look)
   - Trade-off: Longer document, but well-organized sections mitigate this

## üìù Notes

### User Preferences Applied

1. **Version-Specific Docs**: Created TESTING.md in `docs/v0.0.2/` per user guidance
2. **Entire Repo Linting**: Ran linting on entire repo, not just modified files
3. **Headers Over Emphasis**: Noted preference for `### Header` over `**Bold**`
4. **All 4 Doc Tasks**: Completed README, TESTING.md, godot_test/README, cleanup

### Outstanding Items

1. **Test Coverage Badge**: Deferred until CI integration available
2. **Godot UI Screenshots**: Deferred (not required for v0.0.2)
3. **Emphasis vs. Headers**: Manual review needed (linter doesn't auto-fix)

### Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Checklist drift continues if not addressed
  - **Mitigation**: Update tracking docs immediately when completing work
  
- **Risk**: TESTING.md becomes outdated as testing evolves
  - **Mitigation**: Include "Last Updated" date, version tracking in doc header
  
- **Risk**: Long documents (500+ lines) hard to navigate
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive table of contents, clear section headers
