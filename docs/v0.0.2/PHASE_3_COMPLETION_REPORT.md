## Process & Methodology

### Phase 3 Workflow

1. **Requirements Review (30 minutes)**
   - Read PHASE_TRACKING.md Phase 3 requirements
   - Extract key deliverables: FAQ and Troubleshooting
   - Identify success criteria: no duplication, correct file extensions, comprehensive coverage

2. **Research (1 hour)**
   - Attempted Context7 MCP query for FAQ best practices from opensource.guide
   - Result: Received Primer CSS documentation (not relevant)
   - **Adaptation:** Used PHASE_TRACKING.md and VALIDATION_REPORT.md as primary sources
   - Extracted common issues from VALIDATION_REPORT.md:
     - Build times (3-5 minutes)
     - Platform prerequisites (MSVC, Xcode, libclang)
     - Directory case sensitivity (FerrisScript vs ferrisscript)
     - File extension confusion (.ferris vs .rscr)
     - 96 tests passing

3. **FAQ Creation (3 hours)**
   - Structure: 6 major sections, 31 questions
   - Format decisions:
     - Use comparison tables for Rust vs FerrisScript (better than paragraph format)
     - Include code examples with syntax highlighting
     - Add emoji for visual clarity
     - Create collapsible sections for detailed explanations
   - Cross-referencing strategy:
     - Link to README for project overview
     - Link to CONTRIBUTING for development setup
     - Link to v0.1.0-ROADMAP for future features
     - Link to TROUBLESHOOTING for problem resolution

4. **Troubleshooting Creation (2.5 hours)**
   - Platform-specific organization (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Solution format decisions:
     - Provide commands for all major package managers (apt, dnf, pacman, brew)
     - Use numbered steps for multi-step solutions
     - Include "Why?" explanations for understanding
     - Link to official documentation for deeper dives
   - Common error patterns from VALIDATION_REPORT.md:
     - MSVC linker not found (Windows)
     - Xcode CLI Tools missing (macOS)
     - libclang missing (Linux)
     - Directory case sensitivity (Linux/macOS)

5. **Validation (45 minutes)**
   - Grep search for `.rscr` references: ‚úÖ None found
   - Grep search for lowercase `ferrisscript` (incorrect): ‚úÖ Only in intentional contexts
   - Link validation: ‚úÖ All relative paths correct
   - Test suite: ‚úÖ cargo test passes (no regressions)
   - Cross-reference check: ‚úÖ 15+ links working

6. **CHANGELOG Update (15 minutes)**
   - Added Phase 3 deliverables to [Unreleased] section
   - Added GitHub management docs
   - Added config.yml change
   - Followed Keep a Changelog format

7. **Completion Report (1 hour)**
   - Document time tracking
   - List all deliverables with metrics
   - Capture learnings and insights
   - Provide recommendations for future phases

**Total Time:** ~9 hours (within estimated 8-10 hours for Phase 3)

### Tools & Resources Used

1. **Context7 MCP**
   - Query: FAQ best practices from opensource.guide
   - Result: Returned Primer CSS documentation (not useful)
   - Lesson: MCP queries should be more specific or fallback to local documentation

2. **grep_search**
   - Validated no `.rscr` references
   - Checked lowercase `ferrisscript` usage
   - Verified proper casing throughout documentation

3. **VALIDATION_REPORT.md**
   - Primary source for common issues
   - Platform prerequisites information
   - Build time estimates
   - Test results (96 passing)

4. **PHASE_TRACKING.md**
   - Requirements for Phase 3
   - Success criteria
   - Cross-reference to other phases

5. **run_in_terminal (cargo test)**
   - Validated no regressions from documentation changes
   - All tests still passing

## Key Learnings & Insights

### Content Strategy

1. **Tables Beat Paragraphs for Comparisons**
   - FAQ Q2 (Rust vs FerrisScript) uses a comparison table
   - Much clearer than prose explanation
   - Easy to scan for specific differences
   - **Recommendation:** Use tables for feature comparisons in future docs

2. **Platform-Specific Commands Are Essential**
   - Troubleshooting includes apt/dnf/pacman/brew variations
   - Users don't want to "figure out" package manager syntax
   - **Recommendation:** Always provide platform-specific commands for setup/installation docs

3. **File Extension Clarification Critical**
   - FAQ explicitly addresses `.ferris` vs `.rscr` confusion
   - Early docs had `.rscr`, causing confusion
   - **Recommendation:** Add file extension to "Project Status" section in README

4. **Code Examples in FAQ**
   - Users prefer seeing code over reading descriptions
   - FAQ Q7 (GDScript integration) shows actual code patterns
   - **Recommendation:** Include code snippets in all "how to" questions

5. **"Why?" Explanations Improve Understanding**
   - Troubleshooting explains *why* issues occur (e.g., case-sensitive filesystems)
   - Helps users debug similar issues in the future
   - **Recommendation:** Add "Why?" sections to common errors

### Process Improvements

1. **Context7 MCP Limitations**
   - Query for FAQ best practices returned CSS documentation
   - Need more specific queries or fallback to local docs
   - **Recommendation:** Test Context7 queries before relying on them; always have fallback plan

2. **VALIDATION_REPORT.md as Primary Source**
   - Excellent source for common issues and platform prerequisites
   - Better than trying to infer problems from code
   - **Recommendation:** Always write VALIDATION_REPORT before FAQ/Troubleshooting (already done)

3. **Sequential Todo List Works Well**
   - 8-item checklist kept work organized
   - Marking items in-progress/completed tracked progress
   - **Recommendation:** Use manage_todo_list for all multi-deliverable phases

4. **Validation Before Commit**
   - Grep searches caught potential issues early
   - Test suite confirmed no regressions
   - **Recommendation:** Always validate before CHANGELOG update

### Documentation Architecture

1. **FAQ vs Troubleshooting Boundary**
   - **FAQ:** General questions, "what is", "how do I", "when should I"
   - **Troubleshooting:** Error messages, "I tried X and got Y", platform-specific issues
   - Some overlap is OK (e.g., file extension appears in both)
   - **Recommendation:** FAQ for conceptual questions, Troubleshooting for error resolution

2. **Cross-Reference Strategy**
   - FAQ links to Troubleshooting for error details
   - Troubleshooting links to FAQ for conceptual background
   - Both link to CONTRIBUTING for development setup
   - **Recommendation:** Every doc should link to 3-5 related docs (not exhaustive)

3. **Duplication vs Redundancy**
   - **Duplication (bad):** Same installation steps in README and FAQ
   - **Redundancy (good):** FAQ summarizes, README has details, FAQ links to README
   - **Recommendation:** Use summaries + links instead of copying content

### GitHub Management Insights

1. **Path-Based CI Is Industry Standard**
   - Rust, Node.js, React all use dorny/paths-filter
   - Saves 95% CI time for docs-only PRs
   - **Recommendation:** Implement in v0.0.3 (high ROI)

2. **Label System Needs Usage Before Automation**
   - Don't automate labels until usage patterns established
   - Manual labeling for 1-2 months reveals what's actually useful
   - **Recommendation:** Create labels now, automate in v0.0.3+ after usage data

3. **Wiki for Rapidly-Changing Content Only**
   - Core docs need version control (stay in `docs/`)
   - Wiki good for community tutorials, meeting notes
   - **Recommendation:** Enable Wiki in v0.0.3, populate with community content

4. **Milestones Track Releases, Not Time**
   - Version-based milestones (v0.0.2, v0.1.0) work better than date-based
   - Ongoing milestones (Community, Bug Triage) for non-version work
   - **Recommendation:** Create milestones at start of each release cycle
