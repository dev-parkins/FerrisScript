# FerrisScript v0.0.5 Roadmap 🦀

**Version**: 0.0.5 (Patch Release)  
**Focus**: LSP Alpha  
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks  
**Prerequisites**: v0.0.4 (complete editor + API foundation)

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Strategic Goal**: Implement Language Server Protocol for first-class editor experience.

**Key Priorities**:

1. LSP server implementation
2. VS Code LSP integration
3. Real-time diagnostics and autocomplete
4. Foundation for advanced IDE features

**Alignment with v0.1.0 Strategy**: **HIGHEST PRIORITY** feature in reprioritized roadmap. Transforms FerrisScript into a professional development language with modern IDE support.

**This is the most critical release** toward v0.1.0, as it delivers the #1 priority: first-class editor integration via LSP.

---

## 📦 Critical Priority Deliverables

### 1. LSP Server Implementation 🔥🔥🔥

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: 🔥 **CRITICAL** (Highest priority in v0.1.0 roadmap)

**Rationale**: Makes FerrisScript a real development language. Enables professional IDE experience that attracts developers and accelerates adoption.

**Scope**:

#### Phase 1: Basic LSP Server (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Create LSP server project structure
- [ ] Implement LSP protocol handler using `tower-lsp` crate
- [ ] Set up server initialization and capabilities
- [ ] Implement text document synchronization
- [ ] Handle document open/close/change events
- [ ] Basic server logging and debugging

#### Phase 2: Syntax Checking (Week 2)

- [ ] Integrate FerrisScript compiler:
  - Lexer integration
  - Parser integration
  - Type checker integration
- [ ] Real-time syntax error detection
- [ ] Publish diagnostics to client
- [ ] Map compiler errors to LSP diagnostic format
- [ ] Handle incremental document changes

**Example**:

```rust
// User types this in editor:
let x: i32 = "hello";

// LSP immediately shows:
Error[E203]: Type mismatch
  --> example.ferris:1:14
   |
 1 | let x: i32 = "hello";
   |              ^^^^^^^ expected i32, found String
```

#### Phase 3: Autocomplete (Week 3)

- [ ] Implement completion provider
- [ ] Complete keywords:
  - `let`, `let mut`, `fn`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `return`
- [ ] Complete types:
  - `i32`, `f32`, `bool`, `String`, `Vector2`, `Node`, `Color`, etc.
- [ ] Complete built-in functions:
  - `print`, `get_node`, `get_parent`, `has_node`, `emit_signal`
- [ ] Complete user-defined variables
- [ ] Complete user-defined functions
- [ ] Context-aware completion (scope-based)
- [ ] Completion snippets with placeholders

**Example**:

```rust
// User types: "fn "
// LSP suggests:
fn _ready() {
    $0
}

fn _process(delta: f32) {
    $0
}

fn ${1:name}(${2:params}) {
    $0
}
```

#### Phase 4: Go to Definition (Week 3-4)

- [ ] Implement definition provider
- [ ] Jump to variable definition
- [ ] Jump to function definition
- [ ] Jump to type definition
- [ ] Cross-file navigation (if applicable)
- [ ] Definition preview on hover

#### Phase 5: Hover Documentation (Week 4)

- [ ] Implement hover provider
- [ ] Show type information for variables:

  ```
  // Hovering over 'x':
  let x: i32 = 42;
  
  // Shows: (variable) x: i32
  ```

- [ ] Show function signatures:

  ```
  // Hovering over 'print':
  print("Hello");
  
  // Shows: fn print(value: String)
  ```

- [ ] Show documentation for built-in types
- [ ] Show documentation for Godot types
- [ ] Format hover content as Markdown

**Estimated Effort**: 10-15 days

**Technical Stack**:

- `tower-lsp` - LSP protocol implementation
- `tokio` - Async runtime
- `serde` - JSON serialization
- FerrisScript compiler crates (lexer, parser, type checker)

**Components Affected**: New crate: `ferrisscript_lsp`

---

### 2. VS Code LSP Integration

**Priority**: Critical

**Prerequisites**: LSP server implementation (Phase 1-2)

**Scope**:

- [ ] Configure server settings (port, log level, etc.)
- [ ] Add extension commands:
  - Restart LSP server
  - Show server logs
  - Check server status
- [ ] Handle server crashes gracefully
- [ ] Extension activation on `.ferris` files

**VS Code Extension Updates**:

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **NOT** included in v0.0.5:

- ❌ Advanced LSP features (rename, find references, etc.)
- ❌ Debugger integration
- ❌ New language features (arrays, loops, match)
- ❌ Hot reload
- ❌ Multi-file projects (initial focus on single file)
- ❌ Custom LSP extensions

These features are deferred to future versions or v0.1.0.

---

## 📝 Additional Tasks from v0.0.2 Deferral

The following items were deferred from v0.0.2 and align with v0.0.5's focus on testing maturity, CI enhancements, and community growth:

### Type System Improvements

**Priority**: Medium

- [ ] **Type inference for return types** - Infer function return types when not explicitly declared
- [ ] **Type coercion verification** - Ensure implicit type conversions are safe and correct

**Rationale**: Enhance type system robustness. Complements LSP type checking features.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

---

### Testing & Quality Assurance

**Priority**: High

- [ ] **80%+ test coverage goal** - Improve code coverage from current 70-75% to 80%+:
  - Add tests for error recovery paths
  - Add tests for edge cases
  - Add tests for LSP features
  - Update coverage reports

- [ ] **Integration tests (full pipeline)** - Test complete compilation and execution workflows:
  - Lexer → Parser → Type Checker → Runtime
  - LSP features end-to-end
  - VS Code extension integration
  - Error handling across components

**Rationale**: After LSP implementation, more components to test. Higher coverage ensures reliability.

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

---

### CI/CD Enhancements

**Priority**: Medium

- [ ] **Benchmark tracking in CI** - Automate performance monitoring:
  - Track benchmark results over time
  - Detect performance regressions
  - Generate performance trend reports
  - Alert on significant changes

- [ ] **Release automation improvements** - Streamline release process:
  - Automated version bumping
  - Automated changelog generation
  - Automated GitHub release creation
  - Automated VS Code extension publishing
  - Binary artifact uploading

**Rationale**: After multiple releases (v0.0.2-v0.0.5), patterns established for automation. Reduces manual work.

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

---

### Community & Documentation

**Priority**: Low-Medium

- [ ] **GitHub Wiki** - Create wiki for community content:
  - Tutorials
  - Guides
  - FAQs
  - Community examples
  - Tips and tricks

- [ ] **Label automation** - Automate issue/PR labeling:
  - Auto-label by file path (docs/, src/, examples/)
  - Auto-label by keywords (bug, feature, breaking)
  - Auto-label by size (small, medium, large)
  - Manual label patterns established first

**Rationale**: Community size may justify wiki. Label automation after manual patterns established.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

---

**Note**: These deferred items are supplementary to the critical LSP deliverable. Prioritize LSP implementation first. Type system improvements enhance LSP functionality. Testing and CI improvements ensure quality as project grows.

---

## 🔮 Additional Opportunities from v0.0.3 (Workstream Prompt Improvements)

### Carried Over from v0.0.4

**1. Automated Pre-Flight Check Script** (1 day) - **Medium Priority**

**Scope**: `scripts/pre-flight.sh` and `.ps1` to automate manual pre-flight checks

**Benefits**: Quality-of-life improvement, reduces repetitive work, consistent check execution

**Rationale**: Can be combined with other dev tooling work in v0.0.5

**Blocker**: No, manual works fine

---

**2. LEARNINGS.md Template Generator** (4-6 hours) - **Medium Priority**

**Scope**: `scripts/generate-learnings-entry.ps1` to create phase entry skeleton

**Benefits**: After LEARNINGS.md template stabilizes (several versions using it), automation reduces friction

**Rationale**: Good fit for v0.0.5 after template has been used across multiple versions

**Blocker**: No, manual template copying works

---

### New Opportunities

**3. LSP Integration for Error Code Quick Fixes** - **Consider During LSP Implementation**

**Discovery from Phase 1 (Error Codes)**: Each error code has structured information (description, example, fix) that could power IDE quick fixes.

**Opportunity**: When implementing LSP support:
- Use error code descriptions for hover tooltips
- Generate quick fixes from "How to Fix" sections
- Link to ERROR_CODES.md documentation from IDE

**Benefit**: Significantly improves developer experience with actionable error messages

**Implementation**: Integrate during Phase 4-5 of LSP implementation

**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: 🟡 Planning  
**Previous Version**: v0.0.4 (Godot API Expansion)  
**Next Version**: v0.0.6 (Language Features - Optional)
