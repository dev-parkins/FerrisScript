# FerrisScript v0.0.2 Roadmap 🦀

**Version**: 0.0.2 (Patch Release)  
**Focus**: Foundation & Polish  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Prerequisites**: v0.0.1 (released)

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Strategic Goal**: Establish solid foundation for contributors and provide basic editor experience to accelerate development toward v0.1.0.

**Key Priorities**:

1. Community infrastructure for contributions
2. Basic syntax highlighting for editor support
3. Error message improvements for better debugging
4. GitHub project management setup

**Alignment with v0.1.0 Strategy**: This release begins the execution of the reprioritized roadmap by establishing the foundation for editor integration (syntax highlighting) and improving error diagnostics.

## 📦 High Priority Deliverables

### 1. Community Files ✅

**Status**: Partially Complete (Phase 4 work)

**Completed**:

- [x] SECURITY.md ✅
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md ✅
- [x] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ✅
- [x] Issue templates ✅
- [x] PR template ✅

**Remaining Work**:

- [ ] Complete FAQ.md with common questions
- [ ] Complete TROUBLESHOOTING.md with debugging guides
- [ ] Verify all templates are working correctly

**Rationale**: Essential for community engagement and contributions. Creates a welcoming environment for new contributors.

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

### 2. Syntax Highlighting Foundation 🔥

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Critical (Quick Win)

**Scope**:

- [ ] Create TextMate grammar for `.ferris` files
- [ ] Define syntax rules for FerrisScript keywords
- [ ] Add VS Code extension manifest
- [ ] Create basic code snippets:
  - `_ready` function
  - `_process` function
  - `let` variable declaration
  - `fn` function definition
  - `if`/`else` control flow
  - `while` loop
- [ ] Submit to VS Code marketplace
- [ ] Test syntax highlighting on example scripts

**Rationale**: First step in editor integration priority. Provides immediate value to developers and aligns with reprioritized v0.1.0 roadmap that emphasizes tooling first.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Dependencies**: None

---

### 3. GitHub Project Setup

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: High

**Scope**:

- [ ] Create label system (20 labels):
  - Priority: P0-Critical, P1-High, P2-Medium, P3-Low
  - Type: bug, feature, documentation, enhancement, question, discussion
  - Status: needs-triage, in-progress, blocked, wontfix
  - Difficulty: good-first-issue, intermediate, advanced
  - Component: compiler, runtime, godot-bind, docs, ci
- [ ] Create v0.0.2 milestone
- [ ] Add GitHub badges to README:
  - Version badge
  - Status badge (alpha)
  - License badge (MIT)
  - Rust version badge (1.70+)
  - Godot version badge (4.2+)
  - GitHub stars badge
- [ ] Enable branch protection on main
- [ ] Set up milestone tracking

**Rationale**: Professional project management infrastructure enables organized development and community participation.

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Reference**: `docs/GITHUB_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md`, `docs/GITHUB_BADGES_GUIDE.md`

---

### 4. Error Message Improvements (Foundation)

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: High

**Scope**:

- [ ] Add line numbers to all error messages
- [ ] Add source code context (show problematic line)
- [ ] Colorized error output in Godot console
- [ ] Better type error messages with suggestions
- [ ] Test error messages in edge cases

**Example Improvement**:

**Before**:

```
Error: Undefined variable: velocty
```

**After**:

```
Error: Undefined variable 'velocty'
  --> move.ferris:5:10
   |
 5 |     self.velocty.x += 50.0;
   |          ^^^^^^^ not found in this scope
```

**Rationale**: Foundation for enhanced diagnostics in v0.0.3. Improves developer experience immediately and sets up for LSP integration later.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Components Affected**: Compiler error reporting, runtime error handling
