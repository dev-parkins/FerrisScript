# Node Invalidation Priority Reconciliation

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Decision**: Phased integration across v0.0.5, v0.0.7, and post-v0.1.0

---

## üìä Executive Summary

During v0.0.4 Phase 3 development, we identified a node safety issue: NodeHandle uses string-based tracking without validity checking, which can lead to crashes when nodes are freed in Godot. Comprehensive research (663 lines) produced a 3-phase implementation plan.

However, v0.0.5 was already committed to LSP Alpha (the HIGHEST priority feature for adoption). This document reconciles the competing priorities.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Priority Conflict

### Node Invalidation Research Recommendation

| Phase | Version | Effort | Priority | Scope |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | v0.0.5 | 1-2 hours | HIGH | Basic validity checking |
| Phase 2 | v0.0.6 | 3-4 hours | MEDIUM | ObjectID migration |
| Phase 3 | v0.1.0+ | 8-12 hours | LOW | Full weak reference API |

### Existing Roadmap Commitments

| Version | Focus | Timeline | Premium Requests | Status |
|---------|-------|----------|------------------|--------|
| v0.0.5 | LSP Alpha | 3-4 weeks | 11-16 | HIGHEST PRIORITY |
| v0.0.6 | Arrays/Loops | 2-3 weeks | 8-12 | Language features |
| v0.0.7 | Godot API | 2-3 weeks | 8-11 | Math types, resources |

**Conflict**: Phase 1 is HIGH priority safety (1-2 hours) vs LSP is CRITICAL for adoption (3-4 weeks, 11-16 PRs)

---

## ‚úÖ Resolution: Phased Integration

### Phase 1: v0.0.5 Week 1 (Before LSP)

**Decision**: Add Phase 1 to v0.0.5 early, before LSP work starts

**Rationale**:

- ‚úÖ Only 1-2 hours - minimal impact on timeline
- ‚úÖ Safety issue should be addressed quickly
- ‚úÖ Can be done during LSP planning/setup week
- ‚úÖ Doesn't block or interfere with LSP development
- ‚úÖ Improves error messages immediately

**Updated v0.0.5**:

- Timeline: 3-4 weeks (unchanged)
- Premium Requests: 12-17 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (increased by 1)
- Phases: 0 (Node Safety) + 1-5 (LSP)

### Phase 2: v0.0.7 (With Godot API)

**Decision**: Move Phase 2 from v0.0.6 to v0.0.7

**Rationale**:

- ‚úÖ v0.0.7 is "Godot API Expansion" - node improvements fit thematically
- ‚úÖ v0.0.6 arrays/loops are more critical for language usability
- ‚úÖ Not urgent - Phase 1 addresses immediate safety concern
- ‚úÖ 3-4 hours is manageable addition to v0.0.7
- ‚úÖ Gives time for `has_node()` safety pattern to be established
- ‚úÖ Keeps v0.0.6 focused on one thing (language features)

**Updated v0.0.7**:

- Timeline: 2-3 weeks (unchanged)
- Premium Requests: 9-12 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (increased by 1)
- Phases: Node Safety Phase 2 + Math Types + Resources

### Phase 3: Post-v0.1.0 (Deferred)

**Decision**: Defer Phase 3 to v0.2.0 or later

**Rationale**:

- ‚úÖ Requires type system features that don't exist yet (Option, method calls, references)
- ‚úÖ Lower priority - Phase 1+2 address core safety/robustness issues
- ‚úÖ Can wait for community feedback on API design
- ‚úÖ Proper type system support needed first

## üìà Impact Analysis

### Timeline Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| v0.0.5 Premium Requests | 11-16 | 12-17 | +1 |
| v0.0.7 Premium Requests | 8-11 | 9-12 | +1 |
| Total to v0.1.0 | ~37-54 | ~39-56 | +2 |
| Timeline to v0.1.0 | ~10-15 weeks | ~10-15 weeks | Unchanged |

**Key Insight**: +2 premium requests total, but timeline unchanged due to minimal effort per phase (1-2 hours and 3-4 hours respectively).

### Feature Grouping

| Version | Theme | Node Work | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| v0.0.5 | Editor Support | Phase 1 (Week 1) | Safety fix during LSP planning |
| v0.0.6 | Language Features | None | Keep focused on arrays/loops |
| v0.0.7 | Godot API | Phase 2 | Thematic fit with API work |
| v0.1.0+ | Polish/Ecosystem | Phase 3 (deferred) | Requires type system |

---

## üéØ Strategic Priorities

This reconciliation maintains the strategic priorities established in ROADMAP_MASTER.md:

### 1. Editor Experience First ‚úÖ

- LSP remains primary focus of v0.0.5
- Phase 1 doesn't interfere (Week 1, 1-2 hours)
- Editor support is still adoption-critical

### 2. Safety Matters ‚úÖ

- Phase 1 addresses immediate crash risk
- Phase 2 improves robustness
- Properly sequenced based on urgency

### 3. Smaller, Faster Releases ‚úÖ

- Each phase is minimal effort (1-2 hours, 3-4 hours)
- Doesn't disrupt existing release cadence
- Fits naturally into existing version themes

### 4. Thematic Grouping ‚úÖ

- v0.0.5: Editor + Safety = Developer Experience
- v0.0.6: Language Features = Core Usability
- v0.0.7: Godot API + Node Improvements = Engine Integration

## üîç Key Decisions

### Why Phase 1 in v0.0.5 Week 1?

1. **Safety First**: Crashes from freed nodes are HIGH priority
2. **Minimal Impact**: Only 1-2 hours - doesn't disrupt LSP work
3. **Good Timing**: Can be done during LSP planning week
4. **Quick Win**: Improves error messages immediately

### Why Phase 2 in v0.0.7 (not v0.0.6)?

1. **Thematic Fit**: v0.0.7 is "Godot API" - node improvements belong there
2. **Not Urgent**: Phase 1 addresses immediate safety, Phase 2 is robustness
3. **Focus v0.0.6**: Keep arrays/loops release focused on language features
4. **Has_Node Pattern**: Give time for safe patterns to be established

### Why Phase 3 Deferred?

1. **Dependencies**: Requires Option type, method calls, reference types
2. **Priority**: Phase 1+2 solve the core problems
3. **Community Input**: Need feedback on API design before full implementation
4. **Type System**: Proper language support needed first
