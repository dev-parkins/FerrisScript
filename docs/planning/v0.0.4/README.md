# FerrisScript v0.0.4 - Godot API Expansion

**Version**: 0.0.4 (Patch Release)  
**Milestone**: TBD (GitHub milestone to be created)  
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (Quality-focused, no strict deadline)  
**Strategy**: Phased implementation, small focused PRs  
**Branch Pattern**: `feature/v0.0.4-<feature-name>` ‚Üí `develop` ‚Üí `main`

---

## üéØ Overview

**Strategic Goal**: Expand Godot integration to enable real 2D game development without adding new language features.

**Key Focus Areas**:

1. **Signal Support** - Event-driven programming foundation
2. **Additional Callbacks** - Input handling and physics processing
3. **Node Query Functions** - Scene tree interaction
4. **Godot Types** - Color, Rect2, Transform2D support
5. **Property Exports** - Inspector integration

**Alignment with v0.1.0 Strategy**: Major step in reprioritized roadmap by providing comprehensive Godot API coverage before LSP. Enables developers to build real interactive games with current language features.

## üéØ Example Game After v0.0.4

With v0.0.4 complete, developers can build games like this:

```rust
signal health_changed(new_health: i32);
signal player_died;

let mut health: i32 = 3;
let mut velocity: Vector2 = Vector2 { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };

fn _ready() {
    emit_signal("health_changed", health);
}

fn _input(event: InputEvent) {
    if event.is_action_pressed("jump") {
        velocity.y = -300.0;
    }
}

fn _physics_process(delta: f32) {
    // Apply gravity
    velocity.y += 980.0 * delta;
    
    // Move player
    let motion: Vector2 = velocity * delta;
    // ... collision handling ...
}

fn take_damage() {
    health -= 1;
    emit_signal("health_changed", health);
    
    if health <= 0 {
        emit_signal("player_died");
    }
}
```

**Demonstrates**:

- ‚úÖ Signals (health_changed, player_died)
- ‚úÖ Input handling (_input callback)
- ‚úÖ Physics processing (_physics_process)
- ‚úÖ Vector2 math operations
- ‚úÖ Event-driven game logic
