## üéØ What's Deferred (Non-Blocking)

### Programmatic Signal Connection

**Functionality**: `connect()` and `disconnect()` methods

**Why Deferred**:

- Editor-based connections are the primary Godot workflow
- Requires additional complexity:
  - Node path system implementation
  - Callable reference system
  - Additional Godot API integration
- Complexity vs. benefit: Low priority for MVP
- Does NOT block Phase 2 work

**Future Timeline**:

- Phase 1.5 (optional enhancement) or Phase 6
- Estimated: 2-3 days
- Depends on: Node query functions (Phase 3)

## üîç Key Technical Insights

### From Phase 1 Implementation

1. **Instance ID Pattern** - Best approach for signal emission
   - Avoids borrowing conflicts
   - No thread-local storage needed
   - Clean separation of concerns

2. **Boxed Closures** - Required for capturing environment
   - `Box<dyn Fn>` enables closure capture
   - Function pointers insufficient

3. **Dynamic Signal Registration** - Simpler than expected
   - `add_user_signal(name)` only needs signal name
   - Parameters validated at emission time
   - Godot handles type checking

### For Phase 2 Implementation

1. **InputEvent as Opaque Handle** - Recommended approach
   - Avoids reimplementing Godot's complex type hierarchy
   - Delegates to Godot's existing implementation
   - Start with action checks, expand later

2. **Lifecycle Function Pattern** - Established in Phase 1
   - Follow existing `_ready()` and `_process()` patterns
   - Type checker validates signatures
   - Runtime calls functions if defined

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Decision: Signal Editor Visibility (October 9, 2025)

### Context

During Phase 2 preparation, research was conducted on why FerrisScript signals don't appear in Godot's Node‚ÜíSignals panel despite being fully functional at runtime.

### Key Finding

**Root Cause**: Godot's editor introspects `ClassDB` at **class registration time** (compile-time), but FerrisScript registers signals **dynamically at runtime** via `add_user_signal()` in the `ready()` lifecycle method.

**Why This Happens**:

- FerrisScript has **one** Rust class (`FerrisScriptNode`) that loads **many** `.ferris` scripts
- Signals are defined in `.ferris` files, not known until runtime
- Godot's `register_class()` method (where editor-visible signals must be registered) runs before any scripts are loaded

### Design Decision: Accept Limitation for v0.0.4

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Documented and accepted** (not a bug)

**Rationale**:

1. Signals are **fully functional** at runtime (emission, connection, parameters all work)
2. Editor visibility is **nice-to-have**, not critical for v0.0.4
3. Engineering cost for metadata system not justified at this stage (2-3 days)
4. Matches behavior of other dynamic language GDExtensions (Python, Lua)

**Workaround**: Connect signals programmatically in GDScript (fully supported)

### Future Solutions Identified

**Option 1: Predefined Common Signals** (v0.1.0 candidate)

- Declare 5-10 frequently-used signals in Rust `register_class()`
- Custom signals still work dynamically
- Engineering cost: 1 hour

**Option 2: Metadata System** (post-v0.1.0)

- Extract signal metadata during .ferris compilation
- Generate Rust code to register signals statically
- Engineering cost: 2-3 days
- Requires build system integration

**Option 3: Per-Script Classes** (complex, deferred)

- Generate Rust wrapper class for each .ferris file
- Like GDScript's one-class-per-file model
- Engineering cost: 1-2 weeks
- Major architectural change

### Documentation Created

1. **SIGNAL_EDITOR_VISIBILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md** (NEW) - Deep technical analysis
   - How Godot's signal system works (compile-time vs. runtime)
   - Why FerrisScript faces this challenge
   - Research on similar systems (Python, Lua, C# GDExtensions)
   - 4 solution options with comparison matrix
   - Recommended hybrid approach for future

2. **KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md** (UPDATED) - Enhanced signal visibility section
   - Added architectural context
   - Referenced deep-dive document
   - Listed future enhancement options

### Impact Assessment

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Signal functionality | ‚úÖ Works perfectly | Emission, connection, parameters all functional |
| Editor UI visibility | ‚ùå Not visible | Expected limitation of dynamic registration |
| Manual testing | ‚úÖ Fully supported | GDScript programmatic connections work |
| User experience | üü° Acceptable | Workaround is standard Godot practice |
| Future enhancement | ‚úÖ Path identified | Multiple solutions researched and documented |
