## üéØ Why These Changes?

### Godot 4.3+ Compatibility Issue

**Problem**: Users with Godot 4.3+ experienced initialization errors:
```
ERROR: Attempt to get non-existent interface function: 'classdb_register_extension_class5'.
ERROR: GDExtension initialization function 'gdext_rust_init' returned an error.
```

**Root Cause**: gdext 0.4 defaults to Godot 4.2 API. Godot 4.3+ introduced new API functions.

**Solution**: Added `api-4-3` feature flag to target correct API version.

**Impact**: FerrisScript GDExtension now loads successfully in Godot 4.3+

---

### Signal Visibility Limitation

**Discovery**: During Phase 1 testing, discovered that dynamically registered signals don't appear in Godot's Node‚ÜíSignals panel.

**Investigation**: This is **expected behavior** - Godot Inspector only shows compile-time signals (declared with `#[signal]` attribute in Rust or GDScript class definitions).

**Verification**: Manual testing confirmed signals ARE fully functional:
- ‚úÖ Registration works
- ‚úÖ Emission works
- ‚úÖ Programmatic connection works
- ‚úÖ Parameters pass correctly

**Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation explaining the limitation and providing workarounds.

---

### Comprehensive Setup Guide

**Need**: Users needed clear instructions for setting up FerrisScript with Godot, especially handling version compatibility.

**Solution**: Created GODOT_SETUP_GUIDE.md with:
- Prerequisites and installation steps
- Godot version compatibility table
- Troubleshooting for common issues
- Advanced configuration options

---

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Performed

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Environment**: Godot 4.3+, FerrisScript v0.0.4-dev

**Test Script**: `godot_test/scripts/signal_test.ferris`

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ GDExtension loads without errors (after api-4-3 fix)
- ‚úÖ Signals register correctly (3 signals: health_changed, player_died, score_updated)
- ‚úÖ Signal emission from FerrisScript functions works
- ‚úÖ Programmatic connection from GDScript successful
- ‚úÖ Parameters passed correctly between FerrisScript and Godot
- ‚úÖ Frame-rate emission (60 FPS) performs as expected

### Automated Tests

All automated tests passing:
```
running 382 tests
382 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored
```

---

## üìö Documentation Quality

All documentation files:
- Follow consistent formatting
- Include code examples
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Reference related documents
- Include verification checklists

Documentation serves multiple audiences:
- **Users**: Setup guide, troubleshooting
- **Developers**: Technical insights, implementation patterns
- **Future Development**: Phase 2 planning, learnings

## üîç Files NOT Included (Intentionally Excluded)

### Test Files (Temporary, Not for Production)

**Removed/Reverted**:
1. `godot_test/receiver.gd` - GDScript test receiver (testing only)
2. `godot_test/receiver.gd.uid` - Godot UID file (auto-generated)
3. `godot_test/scripts/receiver.gd` - Duplicate test receiver
4. `godot_test/scripts/receiver.gd.uid` - Duplicate UID file
5. `godot_test/test_scene.tscn` - Modified for testing (reverted)
6. `godot_test/scripts/signal_test.ferris` - Modified for testing (reverted to commented-out test calls)

**Reason**: These were used for manual testing but are not needed in production. The test script (`signal_test.ferris`) now has test emissions commented out to avoid continuous signal firing.

### Temporary Functions (Removed)

7. **`call_ferris_function()` in `crates/godot_bind/src/lib.rs`**
   - Was: GDScript-callable method for testing signal emission
   - Removed because: Temporary testing function, not part of planned API
   - May revisit in future if programmatic function calling is needed
