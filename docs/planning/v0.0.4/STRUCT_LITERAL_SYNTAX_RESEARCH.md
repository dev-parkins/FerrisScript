Excellent — based on your completion summary and the **PHASE_4_5_EXECUTION_PLAN.md** document, here’s what’s specifically requested for validation in the **notes section** around *struct literal syntax* (the missing piece before those 30 Phase 4 tests can be fully re-enabled):

### 🔍 What’s Missing for Validation (Struct Literal Syntax)

You’ve implemented **field access** and **runtime type validation** for `Color`, `Rect2`, and `Transform2D`.
However, **struct literal construction syntax** (`Type { field: value, ... }`) still needs explicit validation rules in the compiler:

#### 1. **Type Checker: Struct Literal Construction Rules**

* Add validation for constructing built-in struct-like types (`Color`, `Rect2`, `Transform2D`) using literals.
* Ensure:

  * ✅ All required fields are present
  * ❌ No unknown fields
  * ✅ Field value types match expected types (`f32`, `Vector2`, etc.)
  * ✅ Support nested literals (e.g., `Rect2 { position: Vector2 { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }, size: ... }`)

Example validation logic:

```rust
match type_name {
    "Color" => validate_fields(["r", "g", "b", "a"], expected_type: f32),
    "Rect2" => validate_fields(["position", "size"], expected_type: Vector2),
    "Transform2D" => validate_fields(["position", "rotation", "scale"], mixed_types),
    _ => Err(E704), // unknown struct
}
```

#### 2. **Error Codes (Already Reserved)**

These should be triggered by struct literal validation failures:

* `E704`: Invalid Color construction
* `E705`: Invalid Rect2 construction
* `E706`: Invalid Transform2D construction
* `E707–E709`: Field type mismatch on construction or assignment
* `E710`: Nested field access on non-struct type (used for deeper validation)

#### 3. **Tests That Depend on It**

The 30 commented-out tests (in your notes) correspond to these scenarios:

* Struct literal creation and nested access for all 3 types.
* Invalid field detection (`Color { x: 1.0 }`).
* Missing field detection.
* Type mismatch (`Rect2 { position: 5.0, size: Vector2 { x: 1.0, y: 1.0 } }`).
* Nested field validation (`Transform2D { position: Vector2 { x: "a" } }`).

Once struct literal syntax is validated and parsed correctly, these tests can be restored.

#### 4. **Documentation Note (for your internal notes section)**

You can record this note in your phase summary (right under “⚠️ Notes”) like this:

> **Struct Literal Syntax (Pending Validation)**
> Compiler currently supports field access and runtime evaluation for struct-like types, but type checker validation for literal construction (e.g., `Color { r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0 }`) is pending.
> Once struct literal syntax validation is added:
>
> * Enable 30 commented-out Phase 4 tests
> * Use error codes `E704–E710` for construction/type mismatch
> * Confirm nested literal validation logic (e.g., `Rect2.position.x`) passes type checks
