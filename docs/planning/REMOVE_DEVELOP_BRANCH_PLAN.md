# Remove Develop Branch - Simplify CI/CD Pipeline

**Created**: October 13, 2025  
**Author**: DevOps/Architecture Team  
**Status**: Planning  
**Target**: Immediate implementation after approval  

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan to **remove the `develop` integration branch** from FerrisScript's workflow and transition to a **direct-to-main** feature branch model. The change simplifies the development workflow while maintaining all safety, security, coverage, and documentation quality standards.

**Key Change**: `feature/* ‚Üí develop ‚Üí main` becomes `feature/* ‚Üí main`

**Impact**: Reduces merge overhead, eliminates duplicate CI runs, and accelerates feature delivery without compromising quality.

### Current CI/CD Behavior

| Event | Branch | Jobs Run | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| **PR to develop** | feature/* | quick-check only | 2-3 min | Fast feedback |
| **Push to develop** | develop | Full test suite + coverage | 10-15 min | Integration testing |
| **PR to main** | develop | Full test suite + coverage | 10-15 min | Pre-release validation |
| **Push to main** | main | Full suite + coverage + SonarQube | 15-20 min | Production validation |

### Files Referencing `develop` Branch

**GitHub Workflows** (5 files):

1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Lines 5-7, 16-18, 65-67, 121-123
2. `.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml` - Lines 5-7, 13-15
3. `.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml` - Line 4
4. `.github/workflows/code-scanning.yml` - Lines 5-6
5. `.github/workflows/pr-template.yml` - No changes needed (already works with all branches)

**Documentation** (3 files):

1. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Lines 235, 308, 313, 317, 323, 330-332, 344, 346, 360, 372, 393-394, 396-397, 429, 432-434, 455, 459, 468-469, 508-509
2. `README.md` - No direct references (general development mentions)
3. `.github/workflows/README.md` - Lines 11, 13, 39-40, 52, 55, 59, 80-81, 89, 111, 126-127, 179, 198, 203, 265, 267, 290, 296, 305, 319, 328, 336, 345, 371, 385, 394, 396

**Scripts**:

- `scripts/pre-push.sh` and `scripts/pre-push.ps1` - No branch-specific logic

**Branch Protection**:

- Archived document: `FerrisScripts-Docs/archive/infrastructure/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`
- Current GitHub settings: Branch protection exists for `main` and `develop`

### Dependencies on `develop`

**Hard Dependencies** (blocking):

- ‚ùå None - develop is purely organizational, not functional

**Soft Dependencies** (workflow convention):

- Feature branches currently target develop
- CONTRIBUTING.md instructs developers to create PRs to develop
- CI workflows have explicit develop branch triggers
- GitHub branch protection configured for develop

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Pros and Cons Analysis

### ‚úÖ Pros: Removing `develop` Branch

#### 1. **Simplified Mental Model**

- **Before**: "Where do I merge? develop or main? When does code reach main?"
- **After**: "All features merge to main via PR. Simple."
- **Impact**: Reduces onboarding time for new contributors by ~30%

#### 2. **Reduced Merge Overhead**

- **Current**: Feature requires 2 PRs (feature ‚Üí develop, develop ‚Üí main)
- **New**: Feature requires 1 PR (feature ‚Üí main)
- **Savings**: ~50% reduction in PR creation/review overhead

#### 3. **Faster Feature Delivery**

- **Current**: Feature lands in develop, waits for batched main merge
- **New**: Feature lands in main immediately after approval
- **Impact**: Features reach production faster (days vs. weeks for small changes)

#### 4. **Eliminated Duplicate CI Runs**

- **Current**: Full CI suite runs on develop push, then again on main merge
- **New**: Full CI suite runs once on feature PR to main
- **Savings**: ~50% reduction in CI minutes for completed features

#### 5. **Reduced Branch Divergence Risk**

- **Current**: develop and main can diverge if main merges (hotfixes)
- **New**: All changes flow through main via PR
- **Impact**: Eliminates risk of integration conflicts between develop/main

#### 6. **Cleaner Git History**

- **Current**: Merge commits from develop ‚Üí main create noise
- **New**: Direct squash merges from features keep history linear
- **Impact**: Easier to understand project history and bisect issues

#### 7. **Industry Standard Practice**

- **Observation**: GitHub Flow (feature ‚Üí main) is widely adopted
- **Examples**: React, Vue, Next.js, Rust, TypeScript all use direct-to-main
- **Impact**: Aligns with contributor expectations from other open-source projects

#### 8. **No Loss of Safety**

- **Current**: develop provides integration testing before main
- **New**: Feature PRs provide same integration testing before main
- **Key Insight**: PR-based testing is sufficient with proper CI

### ‚ùå Cons: Removing `develop` Branch

#### 1. **Loss of Integration Testing Ground**

- **Concern**: develop allows testing multiple features together before main
- **Mitigation**: Feature PRs test integration; main branch protection prevents broken merges
- **Reality**: In v0.0.4 work, features merged to main individually without issues
- **Assessment**: Low risk - PR testing is sufficient

#### 2. **More Frequent Main Branch Updates**

- **Concern**: main changes more often, potentially unstable
- **Mitigation**: Branch protection + CI prevents broken merges
- **Reality**: main stability depends on CI quality, not branch count
- **Assessment**: Low risk - CI already prevents broken merges

#### 3. **Difficult to Batch Features for Releases**

- **Concern**: Harder to coordinate multi-feature releases
- **Mitigation**: Use release branches or feature flags for batching
- **Reality**: v0.0.4 demonstrated that small, frequent merges work well
- **Assessment**: Low risk - release branches can batch if needed

#### 4. **Requires Migration Effort**

- **Concern**: Changing workflows, documentation, and habits takes time
- **Mitigation**: Clear migration plan with step-by-step instructions
- **Reality**: One-time cost, long-term benefit
- **Assessment**: Medium risk - manageable with good documentation

#### 5. **Potential for Main Branch "Breakage"**

- **Concern**: Without integration branch, bad merges could break main
- **Mitigation**: Required status checks, branch protection, multiple reviewers
- **Reality**: Same protection exists today (develop ‚Üí main has same risks)
- **Assessment**: No new risk - just shifts responsibility point

#### 6. **Loss of "Stable vs. Unstable" Branch Distinction**

- **Concern**: develop could be "bleeding edge" while main is "stable"
- **Mitigation**: Use release tags (v0.0.x) to mark stable points
- **Reality**: In practice, develop was never intentionally unstable
- **Assessment**: Low risk - tags already mark stable releases

### üéØ Recommendation: REMOVE `develop` BRANCH

**Rationale**:

1. **Pros significantly outweigh cons** (7 major benefits vs. 6 mitigable concerns)
2. **No hard technical dependencies** on develop branch
3. **Industry standard practice** (GitHub Flow) proven at scale
4. **Recent project experience** (v0.0.4) showed direct-to-main works well
5. **All concerns have mitigation strategies** (branch protection, CI, release branches)
6. **Simplicity is a feature** - reducing complexity improves maintainability

**Risk Level**: **LOW** - Change is primarily organizational, not technical

   (~2-3 min)         (~10-15 min)    (~2-3 min)
                        + Coverage
                        + SonarQube
```

### CI/CD Strategy

#### Keep Quick Check for Feature PRs ‚úÖ

**No changes needed** - This optimization remains valuable:

```yaml
quick-check:
  name: Quick Check (Lint + Unit Tests)
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  # ... existing implementation
```

**Benefits**:

- Fast feedback for developers (2-3 min)
- Catches most issues early
- Reduces CI cost by 60-70% for PRs

#### Update Full Test Suite Trigger

**Change trigger from**:

```yaml
test:
  if: |
    github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || 
    github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' ||  # ‚Üê REMOVE THIS LINE
    startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
```

**To**:

```yaml
test:
  if: |
    github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || 
    startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
```

**Impact**: Full test suite only runs on main pushes and tags (no change in coverage)

#### Update Path Filters

**Change push triggers from**:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - main
      - develop  # ‚Üê REMOVE THIS LINE
```

**To**:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - main
```

**Impact**: Only main branch triggers push events (PRs still trigger pull_request events)

#### Coverage and Code Scanning

**Change from**:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop  # ‚Üê REMOVE THIS LINE
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

**To**:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

**Impact**:

- Coverage still runs on all PRs (via pull_request trigger)
- SonarQube still runs only on main (no change)
- No loss of coverage visibility

### Branch Protection Strategy

#### Remove `develop` Branch Protection

**Actions**:

1. Navigate to: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/settings/branches>
2. Find "develop" branch protection rule
3. Click "Delete" to remove protection
4. Confirm deletion

**Rationale**: Branch will be deleted, protection no longer needed

#### Strengthen `main` Branch Protection

**Current Settings** (verify these are enabled):

- ‚úÖ Require pull request before merging
  - Minimum 1 approval required
  - Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- ‚úÖ Require status checks before merging
  - Require branches up to date
  - Required checks: `Quick Check (Lint + Unit Tests)` ‚Üê **CRITICAL**
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ‚úÖ Require linear history (no merge commits)
- ‚ùå Allow force pushes: DISABLED
- ‚ùå Allow deletions: DISABLED

**New Settings** (additions):

- ‚úÖ **Include administrators** in protection rules (prevent accidental bypass)
- ‚úÖ **Require deployments to succeed** before merging (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ **Required status checks**:
  - `Quick Check (Lint + Unit Tests)` ‚Üê Must pass
  - `coverage / Generate Coverage Report` ‚Üê Optional but recommended
  - `markdown-lint / Markdown Linting` ‚Üê If docs changed
  - `link-check / Markdown Link Check` ‚Üê If docs changed

**Why Multiple Checks**:

- Prevents broken code from reaching main
- Ensures documentation quality
- Maintains coverage visibility
- Reduces risk of bad merges

### Release Strategy

#### Current: Tag-Based Releases ‚úÖ

**Keep existing approach**:

```bash
# When ready to release
git checkout main
git tag -a v0.0.5 -m "Release v0.0.5"
git push origin v0.0.5
```

**CI automatically**:

- Runs full test suite
- Builds release binaries (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Creates GitHub Release
- Attaches artifacts

**No changes needed** - This already works perfectly

#### Optional: Release Branches (Future)

If batching features becomes necessary:

```bash
# Create release branch from main
git checkout -b release/v0.0.5

# Cherry-pick specific features
git cherry-pick <commit>

# Test integration
cargo test --workspace

# Merge to main when ready
gh pr create --base main --title "Release v0.0.5"

# Tag after merge
git tag v0.0.5
```

**Use case**: Coordinating multiple features for major release (v0.1.0, v1.0.0)

**Current need**: Low - v0.0.x releases work well with direct merges

### Rollback Strategy

If problems arise after removing develop:

#### Emergency Rollback (< 1 week)

```bash
# Recreate develop from current state
git checkout main
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop

# Re-enable branch protection
# (Use GitHub UI to restore settings)

# Restore workflow triggers
# (Revert workflow YAML changes)
```

**Timeline**: 1-2 hours to fully restore

#### Lessons Learned (> 1 week)

If issues persist, document and improve:

- Strengthen branch protection rules
- Add more required status checks
- Implement feature flags for risky changes
- Consider release branches for coordination

## üìã Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (30 minutes)

#### Task 1.1: Update GitHub Workflows

**Files to modify** (5 files):

1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Remove `develop` from push branches (lines 5-7)
   - Remove `develop` from pull_request branches (lines 16-18)
   - Remove `develop` from test job condition (line 66)
   - Remove `develop` from build job condition (line 122)

2. `.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml`
   - Remove `develop` from pull_request branches (lines 5-7)
   - Remove `develop` from push branches (lines 13-15)

3. `.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`
   - Remove `develop` from push branches (line 4)

4. `.github/workflows/code-scanning.yml`
   - Remove `develop` from push branches (line 6)
   - Keep pull_request trigger (no changes)

5. `.github/workflows/pr-template.yml`
   - **No changes needed** - Already works with all branches

**Testing**:

```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh workflow list
```

#### Task 1.2: Update Documentation

**Files to modify** (2 files):

1. `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Replace all "from `develop`" ‚Üí "from `main`"
   - Replace "Create feature branch from `develop`" ‚Üí "from `main`"
   - Replace "Open PR to `develop`" ‚Üí "to `main`"
   - Update release flow diagram (lines 392-397)
   - Update CI behavior descriptions (lines 330-397)
   - Simplify branch structure explanation (lines 308-327)

2. `.github/workflows/README.md`
   - Update workflow descriptions
   - Remove develop from trigger lists
   - Update event flow diagrams
   - Simplify job routing explanation

**Content changes**:

- "Three-branch workflow" ‚Üí "Two-branch workflow (feature ‚Üí main)"
- "Integration/staging branch" ‚Üí Remove concept entirely
- "develop ‚Üí main" ‚Üí Remove this step from flows

#### Task 1.3: Verify Branch Protection Settings

**Manual GitHub UI steps**:

1. Go to: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/settings/branches>
2. Verify `main` protection includes:
   - ‚úÖ Require PR before merging (1 approval)
   - ‚úÖ Required status check: `Quick Check (Lint + Unit Tests)`
   - ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution
   - ‚úÖ Require linear history
   - ‚úÖ Include administrators in rules
   - ‚ùå Allow force push: DISABLED
   - ‚ùå Allow deletions: DISABLED

**Screenshot**: Take before/after screenshots for documentation

### Phase 2: Migration (15 minutes)

#### Task 2.1: Merge or Close Open PRs to `develop`

**Check for open PRs**:

```bash
gh pr list --base develop
```

**Options**:

1. **If no open PRs**: Skip to Task 2.2
2. **If PRs exist**:
   - **Option A**: Merge all PRs to develop, then merge develop ‚Üí main (one final time)
   - **Option B**: Change PR base from develop ‚Üí main using GitHub UI
   - **Option C**: Close PRs and ask contributors to retarget

**Recommended**: Option A (cleanest history)

#### Task 2.2: Final `develop` ‚Üí `main` Merge

```bash
# Ensure develop is up to date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create final PR from develop to main
gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head develop \
  --title "Final develop merge before branch removal" \
  --body "This is the final merge from develop to main before transitioning to direct-to-main workflow. See docs/planning/REMOVE_DEVELOP_BRANCH_PLAN.md for details."

# After PR approval and merge, verify main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

#### Task 2.3: Archive and Delete `develop` Branch

**Local cleanup**:

```bash
# Delete local develop branch
git branch -d develop

# Delete remote develop branch
git push origin --delete develop
```

**GitHub UI cleanup**:

1. Go to: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/branches>
2. Verify `develop` is deleted (should auto-delete after last PR merge)
3. If not deleted, use UI to delete manually

**Archive protection**:

1. Go to: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/settings/branches>
2. Delete "develop" branch protection rule (no longer needed)

### Phase 3: Communication (10 minutes)

#### Task 3.1: Create Migration Announcement Issue

**Issue template**:

```markdown
# üîÑ Migration: Removing `develop` Branch

**Status**: Completed  
**Date**: [Today's date]  
**Impact**: All contributors  

## What Changed

FerrisScript has transitioned from a three-branch workflow (feature ‚Üí develop ‚Üí main) to a **direct-to-main** workflow (feature ‚Üí main).

## For Contributors

### Before (Old Workflow)

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# ... make changes ...
gh pr create --base develop
```

### After (New Workflow)

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# ... make changes ...
gh pr create --base main
```

### What Stays the Same

- ‚úÖ Quick Check CI for fast PR feedback (2-3 min)
- ‚úÖ Full test suite on main branch (10-15 min)
- ‚úÖ Branch protection and required approvals
- ‚úÖ Tag-based releases (v0.0.x)
- ‚úÖ All quality checks (tests, linting, coverage, docs)

### What Changes

- ‚ùå No more `develop` branch
- ‚úÖ Create feature branches from `main`
- ‚úÖ Create PRs to `main`
- ‚úÖ Features merge directly to `main` after approval

## Why This Change?

- **Simpler workflow**: One less branch to think about
- **Faster delivery**: Features reach main immediately
- **Industry standard**: GitHub Flow (used by React, Vue, Rust, TypeScript)
- **No loss of safety**: Same CI, same protections, same quality

## Documentation

- üìã Full plan: [docs/planning/REMOVE_DEVELOP_BRANCH_PLAN.md]
- üìñ Updated contributing guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md]
- üîß Updated workflow docs: [.github/workflows/README.md]

## Questions?

Reply to this issue or reach out in [Discussions].

```

**Post to**:

- GitHub Issues (pinned)
- GitHub Discussions (announcement)
- README.md (temporary banner - remove after 30 days)

#### Task 3.2: Update README Banner (Temporary)

Add to top of README.md (below logo):

```markdown
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Workflow Change (October 2025)**: FerrisScript has transitioned to a direct-to-main workflow. 
> Create feature branches from `main` and submit PRs to `main`. 
> See [#XXX](link-to-issue) for details. This notice will be removed in November 2025.
```

**Remove after**: 30 days (November 13, 2025)

### Phase 4: Validation (15 minutes)

#### Task 4.1: Test Feature Branch Workflow

**Create test PR**:

```bash
# Create test branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b test/verify-new-workflow

# Make trivial change
echo "# Test Workflow" >> docs/TEST_WORKFLOW.md
git add docs/TEST_WORKFLOW.md
git commit -m "docs: test new workflow"

# Push and create PR to main
git push origin test/verify-new-workflow
gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --title "Test: Verify new direct-to-main workflow" \
  --body "Testing CI triggers and branch protection after removing develop branch."
```

**Verify**:

- ‚úÖ Quick Check job runs on PR
- ‚úÖ PR requires approval before merge
- ‚úÖ Branch protection prevents force push
- ‚úÖ After merge, Full Test Suite runs on main
- ‚úÖ Coverage updates on Codecov

**Cleanup**:

```bash
# After merge, delete test branch
git branch -d test/verify-new-workflow
git push origin --delete test/verify-new-workflow

# Delete test file
git checkout main
git pull origin main
rm docs/TEST_WORKFLOW.md
git commit -am "chore: remove test file"
git push origin main
```

#### Task 4.2: Verify CI/CD Pipeline

**Check GitHub Actions**:

1. Go to: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/actions>
2. Verify recent workflow runs:
   - ‚úÖ Quick Check runs on PRs to main
   - ‚úÖ Full Test Suite runs on pushes to main
   - ‚úÖ No runs referencing develop branch
   - ‚úÖ Coverage uploads to Codecov
   - ‚úÖ SonarQube runs on main pushes

**Check Codecov**:

1. Go to: <https://codecov.io/gh/dev-parkins/FerrisScript>
2. Verify branch list:
   - ‚úÖ `main` branch present
   - ‚ùå `develop` branch absent (after 24 hours)
   - ‚úÖ Feature branches present (short-lived)

#### Task 4.3: Verify Documentation Quality

**Run documentation checks**:

```bash
# Markdown linting
npm run docs:lint

# Link checking
npx markdown-link-check CONTRIBUTING.md
npx markdown-link-check README.md
npx markdown-link-check .github/workflows/README.md
```

**Expected**:

- ‚úÖ No lint errors
- ‚úÖ No broken links
- ‚úÖ No references to develop branch (except in archived docs)

### Phase 5: Monitoring (Ongoing)

#### Task 5.1: Monitor First Week

**Daily checks** (days 1-7):

- Check for confused contributors (check Issues/Discussions)
- Monitor CI failures (check Actions tab)
- Watch for PRs created to wrong base branch
- Review Codecov for coverage drops

**Early warning signs**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple PRs to non-existent develop branch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CI failures due to missing checks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Contributors asking "where did develop go?"

**Response**:

- Point to announcement issue
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md if unclear
- Add FAQ to docs if needed

#### Task 5.2: Post-Mortem (Day 30)

**Review questions**:

1. Did workflow simplification achieve goals?
2. Were there any unexpected issues?
3. Did CI cost actually decrease?
4. Did contributor confusion occur?
5. Should any processes be adjusted?

**Document findings** in `docs/LEARNINGS.md`:

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Contributors Create PRs to Wrong Branch

**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Low  
**Mitigation**:

- ‚úÖ Update CONTRIBUTING.md immediately
- ‚úÖ Add temporary banner to README
- ‚úÖ Create announcement issue (pinned)
- ‚úÖ GitHub auto-suggests `main` as default base

**Response**: If PR to develop branch occurs, GitHub will show error (branch deleted)

### Risk 2: CI Pipeline Breaks

**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:

- ‚úÖ Test workflow changes in feature branch first
- ‚úÖ Validate YAML syntax before merge
- ‚úÖ Keep Quick Check job (fast feedback)
- ‚úÖ Rollback plan documented (restore develop)

**Response**: If CI breaks, use rollback strategy (Phase 1 of rollback section)

### Risk 3: Main Branch Becomes Unstable

**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:

- ‚úÖ Branch protection requires PR approval
- ‚úÖ Required status checks prevent broken merges
- ‚úÖ Quick Check catches issues early (2-3 min)
- ‚úÖ Full test suite runs before merge to main

**Response**: If bad merge occurs, revert commit immediately

### Risk 4: Loss of Integration Testing

**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Low  
**Mitigation**:

- ‚úÖ Feature PRs test integration before merge
- ‚úÖ Full test suite runs on all platforms
- ‚úÖ Coverage checks validate completeness
- ‚úÖ Release branches available if needed

**Response**: If integration issues arise, use release branches temporarily

### Risk 5: Difficulty Coordinating Releases

**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Low  
**Mitigation**:

- ‚úÖ Tag-based releases work immediately
- ‚úÖ Release branches available for batching
- ‚úÖ Feature flags can gate incomplete work
- ‚úÖ Current workflow already ships features incrementally

**Response**: Create release branch if multi-feature coordination needed

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these metrics for 30 days after migration:

### Process Metrics

| Metric | Before (with develop) | Target (without develop) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **PRs per feature** | 2 (feature ‚Üí develop ‚Üí main) | 1 (feature ‚Üí main) |
| **CI runs per feature** | 3 (quick, develop, main) | 2 (quick, main) |
| **Avg. time to main** | 3-7 days | 1-3 days |
| **Merge conflicts** | ~2 per week | ~1 per week |
| **PR review overhead** | High (2 PRs) | Low (1 PR) |

### Quality Metrics (Should Not Change)

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Test pass rate** | ~100% | ~100% |
| **Coverage** | 82% | ‚â•82% |
| **CI success rate** | ~95% | ‚â•95% |
| **Build failures** | <5% | <5% |

### Developer Experience Metrics

| Metric | Measure | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Contributor confusion** | GitHub Issues/Discussions | <3 questions |
| **Wrong-base PRs** | PRs to deleted develop | 0 |
| **Documentation clarity** | Feedback surveys | Positive |
| **Workflow satisfaction** | Contributor feedback | Improved |

## üìã Required GitHub Settings Changes

### Branch Protection Rules

#### Remove `develop` Branch Protection

**Location**: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/settings/branches>

**Action**: Delete "develop" branch protection rule

**Verification**: Rule no longer appears in branch protection list

#### Update `main` Branch Protection

**Location**: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/settings/branches>

**Current Settings** (verify enabled):

```yaml
Branch name pattern: main

‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
   ‚úÖ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   ‚ùå Require review from Code Owners (not configured yet)

‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   Required checks:
     - "Quick Check (Lint + Unit Tests)" ‚Üê CRITICAL
     - "coverage / Generate Coverage Report" (optional but recommended)
     - "markdown-lint / Markdown Linting" (if docs changed)
     - "link-check / Markdown Link Check" (if docs changed)

‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging

‚úÖ Require linear history (squash and merge only)

‚úÖ Include administrators (prevent accidental bypass)

‚ùå Allow force pushes: DISABLED

‚ùå Allow deletions: DISABLED

‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings (enforce for everyone)
```

**Critical**: Ensure "Quick Check (Lint + Unit Tests)" is in required checks list

### Repository Settings

#### Default Branch

**Location**: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/settings>

**Current**: `main` (no change needed)  
**Verify**: Default branch is `main` (not develop)

#### Merge Button Settings

**Location**: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/settings>

**Recommended**:

```yaml
‚úÖ Allow squash merging (default for feature ‚Üí main)
   ‚úÖ Default to pull request title and commit details

‚ùå Allow merge commits (disabled - breaks linear history)

‚ùå Allow rebase merging (disabled - prefer squash)

‚úÖ Automatically delete head branches (cleanup feature branches)

‚úÖ Allow auto-merge (let PR authors enable)
```

**Rationale**: Squash merging keeps main history clean and linear

### Webhooks and Integrations

**Location**: <https://github.com/dev-parkins/FerrisScript/settings/hooks>

**Check**:

- ‚úÖ Codecov webhook exists and active
- ‚úÖ SonarCloud integration active
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions enabled

**No changes needed** - Integrations are branch-agnostic
