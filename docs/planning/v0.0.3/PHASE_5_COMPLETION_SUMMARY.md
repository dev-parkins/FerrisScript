## üéì Key Lessons Learned

### Icon Theme Architecture

**Discovery**: VS Code icon themes are complete replacements, not augmentations.

**Impact**: Cannot add single file icon without defining 100+ file types.

**Decision**: Removed icon theme feature (follows best practices of other language extensions).

**Documentation**: Comprehensive analysis in `docs/LEARNINGS.md`.

### VSIX Packaging

**Discovery**: Extensions require proper `activationEvents` and `.vscodeignore` configuration.

**Solution**: Added activation events, fixed ignore rules, included icon and license.

### CLI Dependency

**Discovery**: FerrisScript has no standalone CLI executable.

**Impact**: Diagnostic features cannot work until CLI is implemented.

**Decision**: Documented limitation, kept infrastructure in place for future.

## üîÑ Deferred Work

### Priority 1: CLI Implementation (Required for Diagnostics)

**Tasks**:

- Add `[[bin]]` target to `Cargo.toml`
- Create `src/bin/ferrisscript.rs`
- Implement error output in expected format
- Build and install to PATH

**Impact**: Diagnostic provider will immediately start working.

### Priority 2: LSP Server (v0.0.5)

**Features Deferred**:

- Go-to-definition
- Find references
- Rename symbol
- Code actions
- Real-time diagnostics

**Rationale**: Current simple providers sufficient for v0.0.3.
