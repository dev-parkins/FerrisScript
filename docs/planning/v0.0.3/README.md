- Component changes
- Test coverage requirements
- Quality gates (clippy, formatting, link checking)
- Dependencies
- Estimated effort

See individual phase documents for details.

2. **Implement**: Follow acceptance criteria in phase document
3. **Test**: Meet test coverage targets (80%+)
4. **Lint**: Pass clippy, formatting, link checks
5. **PR**: Open PR to `develop` with phase checklist
6. **Review**: Address feedback, ensure quality gates pass
7. **Merge**: Merge to `develop` after approval
8. **Integration**: Periodically merge `develop` to `main`
