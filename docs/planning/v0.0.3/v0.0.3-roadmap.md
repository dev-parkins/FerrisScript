**Priority**: Critical

**Prerequisites**: v0.0.2 error message foundation

**Scope**:

- [x] Implement error code system (E001, E002, etc.) - **Phase 1 Complete** ✅
- [x] Add "Did you mean?" suggestions for common typos - **Phase 2 Complete** ✅
  - [x] Variable name typos (Levenshtein distance)
  - [x] Function name typos
  - [x] Type name typos
  - [ ] Keyword suggestions (Deferred to Phase 2B)
- [ ] Link errors to documentation (Phase 3)
- [x] Create error code reference documentation (ERROR_CODES.md) ✅
- [ ] Improve error recovery (continue parsing after errors) (Future phase)

**Error Code Categories**:

- E001-E099: Lexical errors
- E100-E199: Syntax errors
- E200-E299: Type errors
- E300-E399: Semantic errors
- E400-E499: Runtime errors

**Example Enhancement**:

**Before** (v0.0.2):

```
Error: Undefined variable 'velocty'
  --> move.ferris:5:10
   |
 5 |     self.velocty.x += 50.0;
   |          ^^^^^^^ not found in this scope
```

**After** (v0.0.3):

```
Error[E201]: Undefined variable
  --> move.ferris:5:10
   |
 5 |     self.velocty.x += 50.0;
   |          ^^^^^^^ not found in this scope
   |
help: a variable with a similar name exists
   |
 5 |     self.velocity.x += 50.0;
   |          ^^^^^^^^
   |
   = note: see https://ferrisscript.dev/errors/E201 for more information
```

**Rationale**: Significantly improves debugging experience. Sets up error reporting infrastructure for LSP integration in v0.0.5.

## 📝 Notes

### 🌳 Development Workflow (NEW in v0.0.3)

**Starting with v0.0.3, we're implementing a staged development workflow to improve integration testing and CI efficiency.**

#### Branching Strategy

**Branch Structure**:

- `main`: Production-ready code, protected, only receives PRs from `develop`
- `develop`: Integration/staging branch for feature testing
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches (created from `develop`)

**Workflow**:

1. **Create feature branch from develop**:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Develop and test locally**:

   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
   ```

3. **PR feature → develop** (for integration testing):
   - Minimal CI runs on feature branches (lint + unit tests only)
   - Full CI suite runs on `develop` after merge
   - Multiple features can be integrated and tested together

4. **PR develop → main** (for release):
   - After multiple features tested on `develop`
   - Full CI suite runs on `main` after merge
   - Triggers release preparation workflow

**Benefits**:

- **Integration Testing**: Test multiple features together before production
- **Batch Releases**: Group related features for better changelog organization
- **CI Cost Reduction**: Avoid expensive full CI runs on every feature branch push
- **Cleaner History**: Main branch shows release-level merges, not individual features

#### CI Optimization Strategy

**Current Issue**: Full CI runs on every feature branch push (expensive, time-consuming)

**v0.0.3 Solution**:

**Full CI Suite** (all tests, cross-platform builds, coverage) runs on:

- `develop` branch (every push)
- `main` branch (every push)
- Pull requests to `main` (for final release validation)

**Minimal CI** (lint + unit tests only) runs on:

- `feature/*` branches (every push)
- Pull requests to `develop` (fast feedback for feature development)

**Manual Trigger** available for:

- Full CI on feature branches when needed (before major PRs)
- Coverage reports on feature branches (for significant changes)

**Implementation** (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  quick-checks:
    if: github.ref != 'refs/heads/main' && github.ref != 'refs/heads/develop'
    # Run only lint and unit tests for feature branches

  full-suite:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    # Run all tests, cross-platform builds, coverage for main/develop
```

**Expected Savings**:

- **~95% CI time savings** for docs-only PRs (skip tests entirely)
- **~60% CI time savings** for code PRs (skip integration tests and cross-platform builds on features)
- **~70% cost reduction** in CI minutes usage
- **Faster feedback** for feature development (2-3 min vs 10-15 min)

**Path Filters** (further optimization):

```yaml
# Skip CI for docs-only changes on feature branches
paths-ignore:
  - 'docs/**'
  - '*.md'
  - 'LICENSE'
  - '.gitignore'
```

#### Migration Plan

**Phase 1: Setup** (with first v0.0.3 feature):

1. Create `develop` branch from `main` (after v0.0.2 release)
2. Update GitHub branch protection rules:
   - Protect `main`: require PR from `develop` only
   - Protect `develop`: require PR from `feature/*` branches
3. Update CI workflow with branch conditions

**Phase 2: Adoption** (throughout v0.0.3):

- All new features use `feature/*` → `develop` → `main` flow
- Document workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Update issue templates to reference new workflow

**Phase 3: Optimization** (end of v0.0.3):

- Analyze CI cost savings
- Tune path filters based on usage patterns
- Add manual CI trigger documentation

#### Developer Experience

**Creating Feature Branch**:

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/error-code-system

# Work on feature
# ... make changes ...
cargo test --workspace  # Quick local validation

# Push and create PR to develop
git push -u origin feature/error-code-system
gh pr create --base develop --title "feat: Add error code system"
```

**Integrating Multiple Features**:

```bash
# On develop branch, after multiple feature PRs merged
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Full CI runs automatically, test integration
# If integration tests pass, ready for release PR

# Create release PR
gh pr create --base main --title "release: v0.0.3 - Editor Experience Alpha"
```

**Benefits for Contributors**:

- Faster CI feedback (2-3 min vs 10-15 min)
- Less wait time for PR checks
- Clear separation of feature vs release testing
- Easier to understand PR flow

### Technical Considerations

**Error Suggestions Algorithm**:

- Use Levenshtein distance for string similarity
- Consider context (variable scope, type compatibility)
- Limit suggestions to top 3 most likely candidates
- Only suggest if similarity > 70%

**VS Code Extension Architecture**:

- Keep extension lightweight (no bundled dependencies)
- Use VS Code built-in APIs where possible
- Prepare for LSP server connection in v0.0.5
- Store user preferences (formatting, snippets, etc.)
