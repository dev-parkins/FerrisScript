# FerrisScript v0.0.4 Roadmap 🦀

**Version**: 0.0.4 (Patch Release)  
**Focus**: Godot API Expansion  
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Prerequisites**: v0.0.3 (solid editor + error reporting)

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Strategic Goal**: Expand Godot integration to enable real 2D game development without adding new language features.

**Key Priorities**:

1. Signal support for event-driven programming
2. Additional lifecycle callbacks
3. Node query functions for scene tree interaction
4. Additional Godot types for 2D development

**Alignment with v0.1.0 Strategy**: Major step in reprioritized roadmap by providing comprehensive Godot API coverage before LSP. Enables developers to build real interactive games with current language features.

---

## 📦 High Priority Deliverables

### 1. Signal Support 🔥

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Critical (Core Godot Feature)

**Rationale**: Essential for event-driven programming in Godot. High priority in reprioritized v0.1.0 roadmap.

**Scope**:

- [ ] Define signals in FerrisScript:

  ```rust
  signal health_changed(old: i32, new: i32);
  signal player_died;
  ```

- [ ] Emit signals from FerrisScript:

  ```rust
  emit_signal("health_changed", old_health, health);
  emit_signal("player_died");
  ```

- [ ] Connect signals from Godot editor
- [ ] Connect signals from FerrisScript code
- [ ] Signal with parameters (multiple types)
- [ ] Signal without parameters
- [ ] Disconnect signals

**Example Usage**:

```rust
signal health_changed(old: i32, new: i32);
signal player_died;

let mut health: i32 = 100;

fn take_damage(amount: i32) {
    let old_health: i32 = health;
    health -= amount;
    emit_signal("health_changed", old_health, health);
    
    if health <= 0 {
        emit_signal("player_died");
    }
}

fn _ready() {
    // Signals can be connected from Godot editor or code
}
```

**Implementation Details**:

- Add `signal` keyword to lexer
- Add signal declaration to parser and AST
- Store signals in environment/runtime
- Integrate with Godot's signal system via GDExtension
- Handle signal parameters and type checking

**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days

**Components Affected**: Lexer, parser, type checker, runtime, Godot binding

---

### 2. Additional Callbacks

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: High

**Rationale**: Enables input handling and physics, essential for interactive games.

**Scope**:

- [ ] `_input(event: InputEvent)` - Handle user input:

  ```rust
  fn _input(event: InputEvent) {
      if event.is_action_pressed("jump") {
          velocity.y = -300.0;
      }
      if event.is_action_pressed("shoot") {
          spawn_bullet();
      }
  }
  ```

- [ ] `_physics_process(delta: f32)` - Fixed timestep updates:

  ```rust
  fn _physics_process(delta: f32) {
      // Physics calculations here
      self.position.x += velocity.x * delta;
      self.position.y += velocity.y * delta;
      
      // Apply gravity
      velocity.y += 980.0 * delta;
  }
  ```

- [ ] `_enter_tree()` - Node enters scene tree:

  ```rust
  fn _enter_tree() {
      print("Node entered the scene tree");
  }
  ```

- [ ] `_exit_tree()` - Node exits scene tree:

  ```rust
  fn _exit_tree() {
      print("Node exited the scene tree");
      // Cleanup resources
  }
  ```

- [ ] `_draw()` - Custom 2D drawing (optional):

  ```rust
  fn _draw() {
      // Custom drawing code
      draw_circle(position, 10.0, Color::RED);
  }
  ```

**Implementation Details**:

- Add InputEvent type to type system
- Register new callbacks in Godot binding
- Hook into Godot's callback system
- Test each callback thoroughly

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**Components Affected**: Type system, runtime, Godot binding

---

### 3. Node Query Functions

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: High

**Rationale**: Enables scene tree interaction, essential for accessing other nodes.

**Scope**:

- [ ] `get_node(path: String) -> Node`:

  ```rust
  fn _ready() {
      let player: Node = get_node("../Player");
      let hud: Node = get_node("/root/HUD");
  }
  ```

- [ ] `get_parent() -> Node`:

  ```rust
  fn _ready() {
      let parent: Node = get_parent();
      print("Parent node found");
  }
  ```

- [ ] `get_children() -> [Node]`:

  ```rust
  fn _ready() {
      let children: [Node] = get_children();
      // Note: Requires arrays (may defer to v0.0.6)
      // For now, could return count or implement basic iteration
  }
  ```

- [ ] `has_node(path: String) -> bool`:

  ```rust
  fn _ready() {
      if has_node("Enemy") {
          print("Enemy found!");
      }
  }
  ```

- [ ] `find_child(name: String) -> Node`:

  ```rust
  fn _ready() {
      let health_bar: Node = find_child("HealthBar");
  }
  ```

**Note on Arrays**: `get_children()` returns an array, which requires array support. Options:

1. Defer `get_children()` to v0.0.6 when arrays are implemented
2. Return a special NodeList type with iterator methods
3. Implement basic array support just for this use case

**Recommendation**: Option 1 (defer) to keep v0.0.4 focused and avoid partial array implementation.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days (excluding get_children)

**Components Affected**: Runtime built-ins, Godot binding

---

## 📊 Medium Priority Deliverables

### Additional Godot Types

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Medium

**Scope**:

- [ ] `Color` - RGBA colors:

  ```rust
  let red: Color = Color { r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0 };
  self.modulate = red;
  ```

- [ ] `Rect2` - 2D rectangles:

  ```rust
  let bounds: Rect2 = Rect2 {
      position: Vector2 { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 },
      size: Vector2 { x: 100.0, y: 100.0 }
  };
  ```

- [ ] `Transform2D` - 2D transformations:

  ```rust
  let transform: Transform2D = Transform2D::identity();
  self.transform = transform;
  ```

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**Components Affected**: Type system, Godot binding

---

### Custom Property Exports

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Medium

**Rationale**: Expose script variables to Godot Inspector for easy tweaking.

**Scope**:

- [ ] `@export` annotation:

  ```rust
  @export
  let speed: f32 = 100.0;
  
  @export(range: 0.0, 1.0)
  let volume: f32 = 0.5;
  ```

- [ ] Property types: int, float, string, bool
- [ ] Property hints: range, file, enum
- [ ] Read from Inspector
- [ ] Update when changed in Inspector

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days

**Components Affected**: Parser, Godot binding

## 📝 Notes

### Example Game Enabled by v0.0.4

With v0.0.4, developers can build a simple platformer:

```rust
signal health_changed(new_health: i32);

let mut health: i32 = 3;
let mut velocity: Vector2 = Vector2 { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };

fn _ready() {
    emit_signal("health_changed", health);
}

fn _input(event: InputEvent) {
    if event.is_action_pressed("jump") {
        velocity.y = -300.0;
    }
}

fn _physics_process(delta: f32) {
    // Apply gravity
    velocity.y += 980.0 * delta;
    
    // Update position
    self.position.x += velocity.x * delta;
    self.position.y += velocity.y * delta;
    
    // Check for ground collision
    if self.position.y > 400.0 {
        self.position.y = 400.0;
        velocity.y = 0.0;
    }
}

fn take_damage() {
    health -= 1;
    emit_signal("health_changed", health);
    
    if health <= 0 {
        // Game over
        let game_over: Node = get_node("/root/GameOver");
