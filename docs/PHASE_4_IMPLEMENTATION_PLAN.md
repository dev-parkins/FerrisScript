#### 2. Documentation Linting CI
- **Purpose:** Automated quality checks for documentation
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml`
- **Time Estimate:** 1-1.5 hours
- **Priority:** HIGH (prevents broken links, enforces consistency)

**Workflow Content:**
```yaml
name: Documentation Linting

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
  push:

```json
{
  "default": true,
  "MD013": false,
  "MD033": false,
  "MD041": false
}
```

  "retryCount": 3
}
```

---

#### 3. ARCHITECTURE.md (Technical Design Documentation)
- **Purpose:** Explain system design for contributors
- **Location:** `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours
- **Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH (critical for contributors)

**Content Outline:**

1. **System Overview**
   - High-level architecture diagram (text-based or mermaid)
   - Compiler pipeline: Lexer â†’ Parser â†’ Type Checker â†’ Codegen
   - Runtime architecture
   - GDExtension bridge

2. **Crate Structure**
   - `rustyscript_compiler`: Lexer, Parser, AST, Type Checker
   - `rustyscript_runtime`: Variable storage, function execution
   - `rustyscript_godot_bind`: GDExtension FFI layer

3. **Compiler Pipeline Detail**
   - Lexer: Tokenization strategy (regex-based)
   - Parser: Recursive descent, error recovery
   - Type Checker: Type inference rules, coercion
   - (Future) Codegen: Bytecode vs native

4. **Runtime Execution**
   - Variable scoping
   - Function calls
   - Godot interop (calling Godot API from FerrisScript)

5. **Extension Points**
   - Adding new types
   - Adding new operators
   - Adding new Godot bindings

6. **Design Decisions**
   - Why tree-walk interpreter (not bytecode yet)
   - Why GDExtension (not custom GDScript VM integration)
   - Why Rust (safety, performance, Godot 4 compatibility)

---

#### 4. Expand examples/ with Detailed READMEs
- **Purpose:** Teach language features through practical examples
- **Location:** `examples/` directory
- **Time Estimate:** 1.5-2 hours
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (helps new users and contributors)

**Current Examples:**
- `hello.ferris` - Basic print statement
- `move.ferris` - Simple node movement
- `bounce.ferris` - Bounce physics

**Enhancements:**

Each example gets a companion README explaining:
- What the example demonstrates
- Line-by-line explanation
- Common gotchas
- How to run in Godot
- Variations to try

**Example: `examples/move/README.md`**
```markdown
# move.ferris - Node Movement Example

## What This Demonstrates

- Variable declaration (`let mut velocity: f32`)
- Godot node property access (`self.position.x`)
- Arithmetic operations
- `_process(delta)` callback

## Code Explanation

```ferris
fn _ready() {
    // Runs once when node enters scene
    print("Movement script ready!");
}

fn _process(delta: f32) {
    // Runs every frame
    // delta = time since last frame (typically 0.016 for 60 FPS)
    
    self.position.x += 50.0 * delta;
    // Moves node 50 pixels/second to the right
    // Without delta, speed would vary based on framerate!
}
```

## Running This Example

### Option 1: Cargo (No Godot)
```bash
cargo run --example move
# Prints compilation output and runtime trace
```

### Option 2: In Godot
1. Create a Node2D in Godot scene
2. Attach FerrisScript custom script
3. Set script content to `move.ferris`
4. Run scene - node moves right continuously

## Common Gotchas

- **Forgot `* delta`:** Node moves at framerate speed (fast on powerful PCs, slow on weak ones)
- **Forgot `mut`:** Compile error if trying to modify velocity later
- **Wrong type for `delta`:** Must be `f32` (Godot's float type)

## Variations to Try

- Move on the Y axis: `self.position.y += 50.0 * delta;`
- Move diagonally: Modify both x and y
- Add velocity variable: Make speed configurable
- Add boundary checking: Stop at screen edge
```

### Secondary Deliverables (Optional)

#### 5. DESIGN_DECISIONS.md
- **Purpose:** Document "why" decisions for contributors
- **Location:** `/docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours
- **Priority:** LOW (nice-to-have, can defer to v0.1.0)

**Content:**
- Why tree-walk interpreter (simplicity, v0.1.0 bytecode plan)
- Why `.ferris` extension (not `.rs` or `.fscr`)
- Why no borrow checker (game scripting simplicity)
- Why mutable-by-default (GDScript familiarity)
- Why GDExtension (Godot 4 native, performance)

---

#### 6. AUTHORS.md / CONTRIBUTORS.md
- **Purpose:** Credit contributors
- **Location:** `/AUTHORS.md` (root)
- **Time Estimate:** 30 minutes
- **Priority:** LOW (can defer until more contributors)

**Content:**
- Project maintainer(s)
- Core contributors (from `git log`)
- Documentation contributors
- Link to GitHub contributors page

## Coordination with GitHub Management (Phase 3 Deliverable)

### Label Creation (from v0.0.2-CHECKLIST.md)

When creating issues/PRs for Phase 4 tasks, use these labels:
- `documentation` (type)
- `P1-High` or `P2-Medium` (priority)
- `good-first-issue` (for example READMEs - easy for newcomers)
- `advanced` (for ARCHITECTURE.md - requires deep knowledge)
- `docs` (component)

### Milestone Assignment

Add all Phase 4 tasks to `v0.0.2` milestone (should be created from Phase 3 GitHub management checklist).

---

## Documentation Organization (From Phase 3 Feedback)

**User Feedback:** "Troubleshooting doc looks decent, while this is in the right place do we possibly need to bucket the phase documents to not sit in the root of /docs to avoid them cluttering?"

**Solution Implemented:** See `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION.md` (updated)

**Phase 4 File Locations:**

**Permanent Docs (stay in root or /docs):**
- `/SECURITY.md` - Root (GitHub expects here)
- `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - User/contributor-facing
- `/docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` - User/contributor-facing (if created)
- `/AUTHORS.md` - Root (GitHub convention, if created)
- `examples/*/README.md` - Next to examples (logical location)

**Development Artifacts (move to /docs/meta after completion):**
- Phase 4 completion report â†’ `docs/meta/phase-reports/`
- Any planning docs â†’ `docs/meta/planning/`

---

## Next Steps After Phase 4 Completion

1. **Create Phase 4 Completion Report**
   - Document time tracking (actual vs estimated)
   - List all deliverables with metrics
   - Capture learnings and insights
   - Provide recommendations for Phase 5

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
   - Add Phase 4 deliverables to [Unreleased] section
   - Follow Keep a Changelog format

3. **Move to Phase 5: Review & Merge**
   - Cross-reference validation
   - GitHub community standards check (should be 100% now)
   - Link checking across all docs
   - Final merge of all feature branches

4. **Reorganize /docs (if not done yet)**
   - Implement `docs/meta/` structure from DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION.md
   - Move phase reports and planning docs to appropriate subdirectories

---
