Perfect — this final section ties it all together.
It’s the **long-term ecosystem roadmap** for FerrisScript inside Godot — not just a language, but an *integrated development platform*.

Think of this as *FerrisScript’s “engine-within-an-engine” vision*:
a world where static analysis, Rust-backed speed, and ergonomic developer tooling redefine what scripting in Godot can mean.

# 🚀 The FerrisScript Ecosystem Vision (v0.5 → v1.0+)

---

## 🌱 **Phase 0.5 – Foundation (Current Focus)**

> “Make it real. Make it stable. Make it visible.”

### 🎯 Core Goals

* Stable compiler/runtime integration with Godot.
* Correct, deterministic lifecycle handling.
* Reliable Cargo-based build pipeline.
* Clean GDScript <-> FerrisScript interop.

### 🔩 Deliverables

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Runtime Bridge**      | Godot ↔ Rust bindings stabilized via `cargo-godot`                 |
| **Lifecycle Callbacks** | `_ready()`, `_process()`, etc. fully supported                     |
| **Signal Bridge**       | Runtime signals supported dynamically                              |
| **GDScript Interop**    | GDScript can safely call FerrisScript functions                    |
| **Build Pipeline**      | `cargo ferris` CLI tool for builds, hot reload, and editor updates |

### ⚡ Milestone Outcome

FerrisScript behaves like a stable scripting language *runtime*, with reliable function calls, scene linkage, and build system — but still runtime-dependent for signal visibility.

# 🧩 Strategic Positioning

✅ **Short-Term Value (v0.5–0.9)**
FerrisScript improves Godot project reliability and iteration speed.

✅ **Mid-Term Value (v1.0–1.2)**
Transforms Godot into a *compile-time aware* engine — deterministic, data-safe, and Rust-integrated.

✅ **Long-Term Value (v2.0+)**
Positions FerrisScript as the **unifying layer between Rust systems and game engines**, enabling shared logic and tools across platforms.

# 🧠 Core Philosophy

> “FerrisScript is not just a faster scripting language.
> It’s an *engine meta-language* — one that lets Godot reason about your code before you even press play.”
