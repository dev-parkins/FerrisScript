# ⚙️ FerrisScript → Godot API Integration Roadmap

---

## 🪴 1. SceneTree & Node System

### 💢 Limitations

* GDScript nodes are dynamic; signals, properties, and methods are runtime-registered.
* Type errors and missing nodes often appear *during gameplay*, not in-editor.
* Dependency chains between nodes are fragile.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Compile-time validation of node dependencies.
* Typed node references (`NodeRef<T>`).
* Static registration of signals & properties during compilation.
* Potential for scene “contracts” (like Rust traits for node behaviors).

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[scene_contract]
trait HealthBarScene {
    fn get_health_label(&self) -> NodeRef<Label>;
    fn get_bar(&self) -> NodeRef<TextureProgressBar>;
}

#[derive(Scene)]
struct PlayerUI { health: f32 }

impl HealthBarScene for PlayerUI {
    fn ready(&mut self) {
        self.get_bar().set_value(self.health);
    }
}
```

---

## 🧠 2. Signals & Events

### 💢 Limitations

* Signals must be declared in GDScript or C# before runtime.
* Dynamically connected signals are fragile and error-prone.
* No compile-time validation that a signal exists or that a callback matches its signature.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Compile-time signal definitions derived from structs.
* Signal signature validation and generation.
* Static connection graph between nodes and listeners.
* Potential use of procedural macros (`#[signal(auto)]`).

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[signal]
fn health_changed(new_health: f32);

fn take_damage(&mut self, amount: f32) {
    self.health -= amount;
    emit!(self.health_changed(self.health));
}
```

*(This would generate a deterministic, type-safe connection entry visible to the editor.)*

---

## 🧩 3. Physics & Simulation Layers

### 💢 Limitations

* Godot physics callbacks (`_physics_process`) are often slow or unsafe to parallelize.
* Deterministic physics simulation isn’t guaranteed.
* Complex simulation logic bloats frame times.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Deterministic compile-time physics passes.
* Parallel-safe simulation APIs (via `rayon` or built-in job system).
* Compile-time fixed timestep verification.
* Strong typing for units (e.g., meters, seconds, newtons).

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[deterministic]
fn integrate_forces(bodies: &mut [RigidBody]) {
    bodies.par_iter_mut().for_each(|b| {
        b.velocity += b.force / b.mass * FIXED_DT;
    });
}
```

---

## 💾 4. Resource & Asset Management

### 💢 Limitations

* Resource loading in Godot is runtime-checked only.
* Missing textures, audio, or script files can silently fail.
* No static dependency map for assets.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Compile-time resource dependency validation.
* Static asset linking (compile-time reference validation).
* Declarative resource types (`#[resource(path = "...")]`).

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[resource(path = "res://assets/sounds/hit.wav")]
const HIT_SOUND: AudioStream = AudioStream::load();
```

*(Fails at compile time if the file does not exist or is of the wrong type.)*

---

## 🌐 5. Networking & Multiplayer

### 💢 Limitations

* GDScript lacks strong serialization and determinism.
* Network sync logic must be manually written.
* No compile-time enforcement of authority or role logic.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Type-safe, deterministic serialization (`#[networked]`).
* Role-based access enforced by compiler.
* Predictive sync with rollback logic guaranteed by types.

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[networked]
struct PlayerState {
    id: u32,
    position: Vector2,
    velocity: Vector2,
}
```

*(Compiler generates serializer, checksum, and sync metadata.)*

---

## 🧩 6. Threads, Jobs, and Parallelism

### 💢 Limitations

* GDScript’s threading is coarse and unsafe.
* No concept of shared immutable data or compile-time thread checks.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Compile-time checked thread safety.
* `#[parallel]` function attribute for safe concurrent systems.
* Cross-thread message passing using Rust-style channels.

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[parallel]
fn pathfinding_system(map: &NavMesh, agents: &mut [Agent]) {
    agents.par_iter_mut().for_each(|a| {
        a.path = find_path(map, a.position, a.goal);
    });
}
```

---

## 🧩 7. Inspector & Editor Integration

### 💢 Limitations

* GDScript tools can extend the editor, but often slowly.
* No introspection for statically defined game data.
* Editor tooling can’t reason about compile-time constants.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Reflection data emitted at compile time (for custom inspectors).
* In-editor autocomplete and docs generated from the compiler.
* Dynamic preview of static constants and expressions.

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[inspector]
struct EnemyStats {
    health: f32 = 100.0,
    speed: f32 = 1.5,
}
```

*(Inspector automatically reflects types and docs.)*

---

## 🧩 8. Build System & Live Reload

### 💢 Limitations

* Godot lacks an incremental build system for scripts.
* Reloading scripts causes runtime errors or data loss.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Incremental compilation via Cargo plugin.
* Deterministic, dependency-tracked builds.
* Hot reload for changed functions with ABI stability.

### 🧩 Example

```
$ cargo ferris hot-reload
→ Detected change in player.fs
→ Reloaded scene Player.tscn (state preserved)
```

---

## 🧩 9. Tool Scripts & Editor APIs

### 💢 Limitations

* GDScript-based editor tools slow with large projects.
* C# tools have high iteration cost and poor integration.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Fast, natively compiled editor extensions.
* Compile-time safe access to Godot editor APIs.
* Inline UIs defined in FerrisScript.

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[tool]
fn generate_level_preview(scene: &mut SceneTree) {
    let preview = scene.instantiate("res://scenes/LevelPreview.tscn");
    scene.add_child(preview);
}
```

---

## 🧩 10. Diagnostics, Lints, and Static Analysis

### 💢 Limitations

* GDScript lints are limited to basic syntax.
* No cross-file semantic validation.
* Plugins can’t introspect compiled state.

### ⚙️ FerrisScript Solution

* Compiler emits static analysis metadata.
* LSP integration for semantic diagnostics.
* Type-safe reflection and auto-documentation.

### 🧩 Example

```ferris
#[lint(rule = "unused_signal")]
fn check_unused_signals(script: &FerrisScriptModule) { ... }
```
