Excellent — you’re already far ahead by having **unit**, **integration**, and **headless runner tests** in place. For a custom language + Godot integration project like *FerrisScript*, you can now focus on strategies that go beyond correctness to **robustness, regressions, and system integrity**.

Here’s a curated list of **advanced testing and validation strategies** specifically for your project tier:

---

## 🧩 1. **Golden (Snapshot) Tests**

> “Lock down expected compiler + runtime output.”

**Purpose:** Detect unintentional regressions in codegen, AST output, or compiled bytecode.
**Pattern:**

- When the compiler emits JSON, IR, or bytecode, write it to a `*.golden.json` file.
- On test runs, re-emit and compare.
- If differences appear → verify whether they’re expected (and update snapshot).

✅ Ideal for:

- AST serialization
- Type inference results
- Diagnostic message output
- Codegen differences

**Example:**

```bash
cargo test -- --bless   # updates golden files
```

---

## 🧠 2. **Property-Based Testing (QuickCheck / proptest)**

> “What if I generate 10,000 random valid scripts?”

**Purpose:** Stress-test your lexer, parser, and semantic analyzer under chaotic but valid inputs.

✅ Checks:

- No panics, crashes, or undefined errors for any valid token sequence.
- Consistent round-trip: `parse → emit → reparse` should yield equivalent AST.

**Example (Rust):**

```rust
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn parse_roundtrip(script in ferris_gen::any_script()) {
        let ast = parse(&script)?;
        let emitted = emit(&ast);
        let ast2 = parse(&emitted)?;
        prop_assert_eq!(ast, ast2);
    }
}
```

---

## 🧩 3. **Fuzzing**

> “Make invalid input your best teacher.”

**Purpose:** Randomly mutate scripts, runtime inputs, or engine interactions to surface crash points.

Use **cargo-fuzz** or **libFuzzer** for:

- Lexing invalid UTF-8 / binary sequences.
- Invalid node references (simulate bad Godot state).
- Compiler CLI arguments or corrupted .ferris bundles.

✅ Bonus:

- Attach ASan (Address Sanitizer) if any unsafe Rust or FFI used.

---

## 🧪 4. **Cross-Language Regression Suite**

> “Compare runtime parity between FerrisScript and GDScript.”

If both languages execute the same logic:

- Write canonical tests in GDScript (truth source).
- Mirror in FerrisScript.
- Compare result snapshots (stdout, logs, deterministic state hashes).

✅ Use cases:

- Signal emission order
- Node path resolution
- Physics step determinism
- Resource serialization

---

## ⚙️ 5. **Deterministic Simulation Tests**

> “If I run this scene 1000 times, do I always get the same checksum?”

**Purpose:** Ensure determinism across builds, OSes, and compiler changes.

**Pattern:**

- Hash scene graph or memory state after N frames.
- Compare with stored golden hash.

✅ Ideal for:

- Physics & AI systems
- Networking sync simulation
- Reproducibility guarantees for deterministic builds

---

## 🧱 6. **Compiler Regression Harness**

> “Treat the compiler like an API.”

**Purpose:** Catch subtle regressions in parsing, type resolution, or diagnostics.

- Run the compiler in `--check` mode across all `.ferris` samples.
- Use GitHub Actions or CI to detect any AST/type mismatches or error count drift.

✅ Add metrics tracking:

- AST node count
- Parse time
- Memory usage

This acts as **performance regression tracking** too.

---

## 🔍 7. **Semantic Diff Testing**

> “Structural diffs, not just text.”

When AST or IR formats evolve:

- Implement `SemanticDiff` that compares two ASTs for meaning equivalence (ignoring formatting).
- Ensures that code rewrites or formatter changes don’t break the compiler.

✅ Example:

```rust
assert_semantic_eq(ast_v0, ast_v1);
```

---

## 🎮 8. **Scenario/Behavioral Tests (In-Editor Simulation)**

> “Test how devs actually use FerrisScript.”

**Pattern:** Use Godot’s `EditorScript` runner or CLI batch mode to:

- Load a scene with FerrisScript components.
- Interact (e.g., trigger signals, hot reload scripts).
- Assert correct runtime results or editor UI behavior.

✅ Especially useful for:

- Hot reload flow
- Plugin interactions
- UI signal binding behavior

---

## 🧰 9. **Performance Baseline Tests**

> “Detect if the compiler suddenly slows down.”

Track:

- Compilation time per KLOC.
- Scene load latency.
- Bytecode size per node.

Store historical baselines and fail CI if regression > threshold.

✅ Helps control complexity creep.

---

## 🌐 10. **End-to-End “Editor Pipeline” Tests**

> “Can a developer go from file edit → compile → hot reload → run → debug without issue?”

Simulate full developer flows in CI:

1. Modify `.ferris` file.
2. Run compiler → reload into headless Godot.
3. Execute scene logic → compare expected output.
4. Inject plugin event → validate tool UI reacts.

✅ Mirrors actual production usage pattern.

---

## 🧠 11. **Mutation Testing**

> “Does your test suite actually *catch* bad behavior?”

Tools like `mutagen` introduce controlled mutations to your compiler and confirm tests fail where expected.
Excellent for ensuring your coverage tests *truly* assert correctness.

---

## 🧩 12. **ABI/Interop Compatibility Tests**

> “Future-proof your bindings.”

Keep fixtures testing:

- GDScript ↔ FerrisScript value passing.
- Variant conversions.
- Node path and object reference lifetime correctness.

Run them across minor versions to ensure ABI stability.

---

## 🧠 Meta-Testing Tip: “Everything in CI”

Integrate all of the above into CI using:

- **Cargo workspaces** with feature gates.
- **GitHub Actions matrix builds** (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Differential tests** across Rust compiler versions (MSRV enforcement).
